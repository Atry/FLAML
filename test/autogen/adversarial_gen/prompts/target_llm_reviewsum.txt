### POSITIVE EXAMPLES ###
Input: Review_1: The only thing I would like to see is an aux cord when I don't want to charge my phone, but It's not a huge deal. The sound is great, and worth the money. The remote works with your phone, and that's precisely what I wanted, Review_2: you need to buy an adaptor for Ipod Nano's so it was disappointing when my son opened it up on Christmas and could not use it for his Ipod Nano. It does not state that anywhere on the box or when I ordered it., Review_3: Love, love, love the ability to save multiple preset radio stations, and the sound is clear, crisp... amazing! It almost makes waking up a pleasure. Another feature I never thought I wanted, but really appreciate, is the ability to set the brightness of the clock readout. Brilliant!, Review_4: The sound of the radio is of real quality. I also like having the two separate alarms and the alarm is not obnoxious yet still wakes us up. My wife charges her iphone on it regularly and works out well. We like the Sony so much I got one for my son and his wife for a Christmas present, Review_5: I was looking quite awhile to locate a decent sounding radio / iPod player which would also charge my iPod. This is perfect for our family. It's a lot smaller than I thought, which is good. And when we update to an iPhone 5, there is a 5 dollars adapter to get so we can still use this radio. Perfect!, Review_6: As always, Sony has a 'winner' in this combined am / fm radio and docking station. Great sound, looks good and wife is very pleased as she put it in her craft work area. Finding the combo of am / fm wasn't easy either.Lots of fm only units. This is a great product., Review_7: My husband really like this speaker... LOVE IT! Its so easy to operate by setting the alarm.. I like the way when you put your iphone 4s to the dock its charge at the same time while you are you using it...! Great product, Review_8: While I like the Dream Machine I don't know why there's so much static. It's nearly impossible to get a couple of my favorite radio stations without constant static in the background. My other radio doesn't do that. I've even tried different locations for it. That's a big disappointment and shortcoming of the product.
Summary: This FM/AM radio, iPhone docking station and alarm clock is a perfect combination! The sound is amazing, the alarm clock is not annoying, and the design looks great! It would be nice to have a place to use an aux cord and certain apple products require a 5 dollars adapter to use the docking station but other than that, this product is fantastic!

Summary: The atmosphere is a typical pub with mediocre food and poor service. Not a great place to eat at, but good for getting beers on draft. The best feature here is the outdoor patio so it's a good place to go for patio drinks, if smokers are not minded.
