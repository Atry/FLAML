### POSITIVE EXAMPLES ###
Input: The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic originating from China in 2002 was caused by a previously uncharacterized coronavirus that could be identified by specific RT-PCR amplification. Efforts to control future SARS outbreaks depend on the accurate and early identification of SARS-CoV infected patients. A real-time fluorogenic RT-PCR assay based on the 3 -noncoding region (3 -NCR) of SARS-CoV genome was developed as a quantitative SARS diagnostic tool. The ideal amplification efficiency of a sensitive SARS-CoV RT-PCR assay should yield an E value (PCR product concentration increase per amplification cycle) equal to 2.0. It was demonstrated that the 3 -NCR SARS-CoV based RT-PCR reactions could be formulated to reach excellent E values of 1.81, or 91% amplification efficacy. The SARS-CoV cDNA preparations derived from viral RNA extract and the cloned recombinant plasmid both exhibit the identical amplification characteristics, i.e. amplification efficacy using the same PCR formulation developed in this study. The viral genomic copy (or genomic equivalences, GE) per infectious unit (GE/pfu) of SARS-CoV used in this study was also established to be approximate 1200-1600:1. The assay's detection sensitivity could reach 0.005 pfu or 6-8 GE per assay. It was preliminarily demonstrated that the assay could efficiently detect SARS-CoV from clinical specimens of SARS probable and suspected patients identified in Taiwan. The 3 -NCR based SARS-CoV assay demonstrated 100% diagnostic specificity testing samples of patients with acute respiratory disease from a non-SARS epidemic region.
Title: Development and evaluation of an efficient 3 -noncoding region-based SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) RT-PCR assay for detection of SARS-CoV
Explanation: It's a correct title because the paragraph described the development of 3 -noncoding region of SARS-CoV genome and assay efficiently detecting SARS-CoV from clinical specimens.

Input: Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are cysteine protease proteins that reverse the ubiquitination by removing ubiquitins from the target protein. With over 100 DUBs identified and categorized into at least 7 families, many DUBs interact with one or more cytokines, influencing cellular processes, such as antiviral responses, inflammatory responses, apoptosis, etc. While some DUBs influence cytokine pathway or production, some DUBs are cytokine-inducible. In this article, we summarize a list of DUBs, their interaction with cytokines, target proteins and mechanisms of action.
Title: Regulatory interplay between deubiquitinating enzymes and cytokines
Explanation: It's a correct title because the paragraph talks about the interaction of deubiquitinating and cytokines that are mentioned in the title.

Input: A novel bat-origin coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and continues to spread across China and the world. At the time of writing, a massive global response has been implemented to control the disease as it spreads from person to person. Yet the high-risk human-wildlife interactions and interfaces that led to the emergence of SARS-CoV and of 2019-nCoV continue to exist in emerging disease hotspots globally. To prevent the next epidemic and pandemic related to these interfaces, we call for research and investment in three areas: 1) surveillance among wildlife to identify the high-risk pathogens they carry; 2) surveillance among people who have contact with wildlife to identify early spillover events; and 3) improvement of market biosecurity regarding the wildlife trade. As the emergence of a novel virus anywhere can impact the furthest reaches of our connected world, international collaboration among scientists is essential to address these risks and prevent the next pandemic.
Title: A strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to the 2019-nCoV outbreak
Explanation: It's a correct title because the paragraph talks about how to prevent future epidemic and to address the risks.

### NEGATIVE EXAMPLES ###
Input: Linking autoimmune orchitis models to human disease • Immunopathological sequelae of vasectomy • Conclusions and future perspectives BACKGROUND: Infection and inflammation of the reproductive tract are significant causes of male factor infertility. Ascending infections caused by sexually transmitted bacteria or urinary tract pathogens represent the most frequent aetiology of epididymo-orchitis, but viral, haematogenous dissemination is also a contributory factor. Limitations in adequate diagnosis and therapy reflect an obvious need for further understanding of human epididymal and testicular immunopathologies and their contribution to infertility. A major obstacle for advancing our knowledge is the limited access to suitable tissue samples. Similarly, the key events in the inflammatory or autoimmune pathologies affecting human male fertility are poorly amenable to close examination. Moreover, the disease processes generally have occurred long before the patient attends the clinic for fertility assessment. In this regard, data obtained from experimental animal models and respective comparative analyses have shown promise to overcome these restrictions in humans.,
Title: dsRNA sensors and plasmacytoid dendritic cells in host defense and autoimmunity The primary response to viral detection: type I interferons,
Explanation: It's an incorrect title because paragraphs because the tasks talk about Infectious, inflammatory and male factor infertility and how do rodent models inform clinical practice?

Input: This review presents a brief outline and novel developments of electrophoretic separation in microfluidic chips. Distinct characteristics of microchip electrophoresis (MCE) are discussed first, in which sample injection plug, joule heat, channel turn, surface adsorption and modification are introduced, and some successful strategies and recognized conclusions are also included. Important achievements of microfluidic electrophoresis separation in small molecules, DNA and protein are then summarized. This review is aimed at researchers, who are interested in MCE and want to adopt MCE as a functional unit in their integrated microsystems.
Title: Clinical characteristics and intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection
Explanation: It's an incorrect title because paragraph talks about Electrophoretic separations on microfluidic chips.

Input: It is known that the person-to-person spreading of certain infectious diseases is related with the transmission of human exhaled air in the indoor environments, and this is suspected to be the case with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. This paper presents the numerical analysis of the human respiration process and the transport of exhaled air by breathing, sneezing, and coughing and their potential impact on the adjacent person in a modeled room with displacement ventilation. In order to account for the influence of the thermal plume around the human body, a three-dimensional computational thermal manikin (CTM) with an accurate description of body geometry was applied. Some of the results were compared with those from former simulations and experiments. It was found that personal exposure to the exhaled air from the normal respiration process of other persons is very low in a modeled room with displacement ventilation. Personal exposure to pollution caused by sneezing or coughing is highly directional. When two occupants face each other the cross-infection may happen due to the long transport distance of the exhalation.
Title: Association of Cytokines in Individuals Sensitive and Insensitive to Dust Mites in a Brazilian Population
Explanation: It's an incorrect title because paragraph talks about Transient CFD simulation of the respiration process and inter-person exposure assessment.
