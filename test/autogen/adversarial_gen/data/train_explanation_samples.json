By decreasing the taxes, carbon dioxide emissions will rise, so the explanation is correct. \nInput: Question: If you put a lot of energy into some food the temperature of it will \n Answer: increase\nOutput: The temperature of matter increases with the added energy.\nExplanation: As mentioned in the input Question and Answer, output statement constructs the explanation correctly.\nInput: Question: If an object starts speeding up, it is encountering _____ friction against it. \n Answer: less\nOutput: The smoother the surface, the less friction against an object, so the faster it will move.\nExplanation: As mentioned in the input Question and Answer, output statement constructs the explanation correctly.", "negative_examples": "Input: Question: The government of Canada is considering implementing less carbon taxes across the country. If these taxes were implemented, the amount of carbon dioxide emissions in the country would be expected to \n Answer: rise\nOutput: The carbon taxes encourage people to use more fossil fuel. which increase carbon dioxide emissions. \nExplanation: This explanation is incorrect. Implementing the taxes encourage people to use less fossil fuel. So reducing the taxes will increase carbon dioxide emissions.\nInput: Question: Shampoos with high ph are \n Answer: more\nOutput: Lower pH numbers are less acidic and higher numbers are less acidic (also called more alkaline).\nExplanation: This explanation is not acceptable. It should explain the relation between high ph and number of the shampoos, not ph and acidity.\nInput: Question: If an object starts speeding up, it is encountering _____ friction against it. \n Answer: less\nOutput: The smoother the surface, the less friction against an object, so the slower it will move.\nExplanation: If an object starts speeding up, it encounters less friction against it. This means that the surface is smooth and it has less friction. So objects can move faster. The slower it will move in the explanation should change to the faster it will move.", "input": "Question: Will is inhaling and then he exhales. Which stage likely causes greater air pressure in his lungs? \n Answer: exhaling", "ground_truth": ["During inhalation, because the chest volume is larger, the air pressure inside the lungs is lower than the air pressure outside."]}]
