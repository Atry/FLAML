Metabolomics is a powerful tool to study the metabolic activities of the gut microbiota and their impact on host physiology and pathophysiology. However, the analytical challenges posed by the complex and dynamic nature of the gut microbiome limit the application and interpretation of metabolomics data. Purpose: The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the current status and future perspectives of metabolomics in gut microbiota research, with a focus on the technical and bioinformatic approaches used to identify and quantify metabolites, link them to specific microbial taxa and pathways, and integrate them with other omics data. Method: We searched the PubMed database for articles published in English from January 2010 to December 2020, using the keywords \"metabolomics\" and \"gut microbiota\". We selected 136 articles that applied metabolomics to study the gut microbiota in health and disease, and reviewed their methodologies, findings, and limitations. Results: Metabolomics has revealed significant associations between the gut microbiota and various metabolic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, colorectal cancer, and liver diseases. Several metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, tryptophan derivatives, and choline metabolites, have been identified as potential mediators of the gut microbiota-host crosstalk, influencing inflammation, immunity, glucose and lipid metabolism, and neurological functions. However, the causal relationships and the underlying mechanisms of these associations are still unclear, and the variability and reproducibility of metabolomics data are affected by multiple factors, such as sample collection, storage, preparation, analysis, and annotation. Moreover, the integration of metabolomics with other omics data, such as genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, is challenging and requires novel bioinformatic tools and databases. Conclusions: Metabolomics is a valuable technique to explore the metabolic functions of the gut microbiota and their implications for human health and disease. However, there is a need for standardization, validation, and optimization of the metabolomics workflow, as well as for the development of integrative and systems biology approaches, to fully exploit the potential of metabolomics in gut microbiota research.", "output": "\n\nSome possible titles based on the provided paragraph are:\n\n- Metabolomics of the gut microbiota: challenges and opportunities for understanding host-microbe interactions\n- Exploring the metabolic functions and impacts of the gut microbiota using metabolomics: current status and future perspectives\n- How metabolomics can reveal the role of the gut microbiota in human health and disease: a review of methods, findings, and limitations\n- The gut microbiota and its metabolites: a metabolomics approach to study their associations with metabolic diseases and host physiology\n- Metabolomics in gut microbiota research: a powerful tool to uncover the mechanisms of the gut microbiota-host crosstalk", "evaluation": 1}, {"input": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation with Lactobacillus plantarum (LP) on growth performance, immune response, and disease resistance in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus).

However, the composition and function of the gut microbiota can be altered by various factors, such as diet, antibiotics, stress and disease. In this study, we investigated the impact of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), a widely used model of depression, on the gut microbiota and intestinal barrier function in rats. We found that CUMS induced depressive-like behaviors, such as reduced sucrose preference and increased immobility time, in rats. CUMS also significantly altered the gut microbiota composition, characterized by decreased alpha diversity, increased beta diversity and reduced abundance of beneficial bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Furthermore, CUMS impaired the intestinal barrier function, as evidenced by increased intestinal permeability, decreased expression of tight junction proteins and elevated levels of plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Importantly, we demonstrated that prebiotic supplementation with galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) could partially reverse the CUMS-induced changes in gut microbiota, intestinal barrier and depressive-like behaviors. GOS increased the abundance of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, enhanced the expression of tight junction proteins and reduced the levels of plasma LPS and pro-inflammatory cytokines. GOS also improved the sucrose preference and decreased the immobility time of CUMS rats.

In this study, we aimed to compare the gut microbiota composition and diversity among three different pig breeds: Landrace, Yorkshire, and Duroc, which differ in their production traits, genetic backgrounds, and geographic origins. Methods: Fecal samples were collected from 90 healthy pigs (30 per breed) raised under the same conditions and fed the same diet. The bacterial 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 regions were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform and analyzed using QIIME2 and LEfSe. Results: We obtained a total of 4,478,892 high-quality sequences, with an average of 49,765 sequences per sample. The alpha diversity indices showed no significant differences among the three breeds. The beta diversity analysis revealed that the gut microbiota composition was significantly different among breeds at the weighted UniFrac distance level (PERMANOVA, P < 0.001). The relative abundances of 13 bacterial taxa, including six genera and seven species, were significantly different among breeds. Landrace pigs had higher abundances of Prevotella 9, Prevotella copri, and Ruminococcus bromii, while Yorkshire pigs had higher abundances of Lactobacillus amylovorus, Lactobacillus mucosae, and Lactobacillus reuteri. Duroc pigs had higher abundances of Oscillibacter and an unclassified genus in Ruminococcaceae. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that pig breed is a major factor shaping the gut microbiota composition and diversity in pigs.

Image captioning is a challenging problem that requires both visual and linguistic understanding. Existing methods for image captioning typically use a two-stage pipeline, where a convolutional neural network (CNN) extracts visual features from the image, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) decodes these features into a caption. However, this pipeline has several limitations, such as the fixed-length representation of the image, the lack of attention mechanism, and the exposure bias. To address these issues, we propose a unified model that integrates a CNN, an attention mechanism, and a transformer network. The transformer network is a recently proposed architecture for sequence modeling that relies on self-attention and positional encoding. We show that the transformer network can effectively encode the visual features and decode them into a caption, while the attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different regions of the image at different time steps.

However, little is known about how health professionals and patients use Twitter to communicate about cancer. This study aimed to identify the frequency, sentiment, themes and user characteristics of cancer-related tweets in a national Twitter conversation. Methods: We collected 288,349 tweets containing the hashtag #WorldCancerDay during a seven-day period in February 2019. We performed a sentiment analysis to classify the tweets as positive, negative or neutral. We also conducted a thematic analysis to identify the main topics of the tweets. We then analyzed the characteristics of the users who posted the tweets, such as their location, profession and gender. Results: The majority of the tweets were positive (63.4%), followed by neutral (30.4%) and negative (6.2%). The most frequent themes were awareness (40.2%), support (25.6%), prevention (16.4%), research (10.3%) and treatment (7.5%). The users who posted the tweets were from 170 different countries, with the United States (20.1%), the United Kingdom (10.2%) and India (8.9%) being the most common. Among the users who disclosed their profession, the most frequent were health professionals (32.7%), cancer survivors (21.4%) and cancer organizations (18.9%). The gender distribution of the users was 54.3% female and 45.7% male. Conclusion: Twitter is a platform that facilitates a global and multidisciplinary conversation about cancer, with a predominantly positive sentiment. The main themes of the tweets reflect the goals of World Cancer Day, which are to raise awareness, provide support, promote prevention, encourage research and improve treatment.

The fusion process is triggered by the binding of gp120 to the CD4 receptor and a coreceptor, usually CCR5 or CXCR4. The conformational changes induced by these interactions expose the fusion peptide of gp41, which inserts into the target membrane, followed by the formation of a six-helix bundle that brings the viral and cellular membranes closer.

In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the conformational dynamics and membrane interactions of the MPER in different fusion intermediates. We found that the MPER adopts different orientations and degrees of membrane insertion depending on the fusion stage, suggesting a versatile role in facilitating membrane fusion.

The viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) is the sole target of neutralizing antibodies and the main determinant of viral entry. Env is a trimer of heterodimers composed of a surface subunit (gp120) and a transmembrane subunit (gp41). The gp120 subunit binds to the primary receptor CD4 and the coreceptor CCR5 or CXCR4 on the host cell surface, triggering conformational changes in gp41 that mediate fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The high variability of Env, especially in the regions exposed to the humoral immune response, poses a major challenge for the development of an effective vaccine. Moreover, Env is heavily glycosylated, which masks conserved epitopes from antibody recognition. Several broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) have been isolated from HIV-1-infected individuals, but their elicitation by vaccination remains elusive.

Diet is a major factor that influences the composition and function of the gut microbiota, but the effects of dietary interventions are often variable and person-specific. A possible reason for this variability is the presence of different gut microbial enterotypes, which are clusters of microbiota with distinct taxonomic and functional profiles. However, the stability, origin, and determinants of enterotypes are still controversial. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that reported enterotype data from healthy human subjects, using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We extracted information on the number and nature of enterotypes, the methods used to identify them, and the association of enterotypes with diet, geography, age, and health status. We also performed a network analysis to explore the co-occurrence patterns of enterotype-defining genera. Results: We identified 19 studies that met our inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 4,998 samples from 34 countries. The studies used different methods to classify enterotypes, but we found that two enterotypes, dominated by Bacteroides and Prevotella, were consistently reported across studies, while a third enterotype, dominated by Ruminococcus, was less common and more variable. The network analysis confirmed that Bacteroides and Prevotella had opposite associations with other genera, suggesting a strong antagonism between these two groups. We found that enterotypes were significantly associated with long-term dietary patterns, particularly protein and fiber intake, as well as some geographic regions, such as Europe and Africa. However, we did not find any association of enterotypes with age or health status.

Metagenomics is a powerful tool to study the structure and function of the gut microbiota, but it is limited by the availability and quality of reference genomes. To overcome this challenge, we developed a novel method to reconstruct high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from fecal samples, using a combination of short- and long-read sequencing and automated binning. Methods: We applied our method to 34 fecal samples from healthy Danish individuals, generating 495 MAGs, of which 349 were classified as bacterial and 146 as archaeal. We evaluated the quality and completeness of the MAGs using several criteria, including marker genes, contamination, and genome size. We also compared the MAGs with existing reference genomes and performed functional and phylogenetic analyses to explore their metabolic potential and evolutionary relationships. Results: Our method produced high-quality MAGs, with 78.5% of them meeting the minimum quality standards for draft genomes, and 63.4% of them being categorized as high-quality draft or complete genomes. The MAGs significantly increased the genomic representation of several gut microbial taxa, especially for the underrepresented archaeal domain. We identified 120 MAGs belonging to the order Methanobacteriales, representing 65 species-level genome bins, of which 44 are potentially novel. The Methanobacteriales MAGs displayed a high diversity of metabolic pathways, including hydrogenotrophic, methylotrophic, and acetoclastic methanogenesis, and novel adaptations to the gut environment, such as genes for cobalamin biosynthesis, F420-dependent enzymes, and host interaction. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a complex evolutionary history of gut Methanobacteriales, involving ancient and recent colonization events, differential gene loss and horizontal gene transfer.

However, the poor bioavailability and low stability of curcumin limit its clinical application. Nanoparticles are emerging as a promising delivery system to enhance the efficacy and safety of drugs. Methods: In this study, we prepared curcumin-loaded poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (Cur-NPs) with a modified emulsion-solvent evaporation method and characterized their physicochemical properties, stability, release profile, and cellular uptake. We also evaluated the effects of Cur-NPs on A\u03b2 production, degradation, and aggregation in N2a cells transfected with the human Swedish mutant amyloid precursor protein (N2a/APPswe). Moreover, we investigated the effects of Cur-NPs on microglial activation and neuroinflammation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 cells and co-cultured N2a/APPswe and BV2 cells. Results: Cur-NPs had a mean particle size of 113.7 nm, a polydispersity index of 0.18, a zeta potential of -27.3 mV, and an encapsulation efficiency of 70.6%. Cur-NPs were stable in different pH solutions and plasma, and showed a sustained release of curcumin. Cur-NPs were effectively taken up by N2a/APPswe and BV2 cells, and showed higher anti-amyloid and anti-inflammatory activities than free curcumin. Cur-NPs reduced A\u03b2 production by down-regulating \u03b2-secretase (BACE1) and up-regulating A\u03b2-degrading enzymes, such as neprilysin and insulin-degrading enzyme. Cur-NPs also inhibited A\u03b2 aggregation by blocking the nucleation and elongation phases. Furthermore, Cur-NPs attenuated microglial activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production by inhibiting nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Cur-NPs also protected N2a/APPswe cells from microglia-mediated neurotoxicity by suppressing nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species generation.

HIV-1 infection is characterized by a progressive depletion of CD4+ T cells, which impairs the immune system and renders the host susceptible to opportunistic infections and malignancies. The viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) is the sole target of neutralizing antibodies and plays a key role in viral entry and pathogenesis. Env is a trimeric complex composed of three gp120 subunits, which bind to the cellular receptor CD4 and a coreceptor (usually CCR5 or CXCR4), and three gp41 subunits, which mediate membrane fusion. Env is highly variable and undergoes extensive glycosylation, which shield it from antibody recognition and pose major challenges for vaccine development. Objective: To review the current knowledge on the structure, function, diversity, and immunogenicity of HIV-1 Env, and to discuss the implications for vaccine design. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar databases, and relevant articles published in English were selected and critically analyzed. Results: The structure of HIV-1 Env has been elucidated by various biophysical techniques, such as X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The functional mechanisms of Env-mediated viral entry and escape from neutralization have been investigated by biochemical, virological, and immunological methods. The diversity and evolution of HIV-1 Env have been studied by phylogenetic, molecular, and epidemiological approaches. The immunogenicity and immunodominance of HIV-1 Env have been assessed by serological, cellular, and animal models. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: HIV-1 Env is a multifaceted protein that exhibits remarkable structural and functional plasticity, as well as extraordinary genetic and antigenic diversity.

One of the most conserved regions of HIV-1 is the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of the envelope glycoprotein gp41, which contains epitopes for broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) such as 2F5, 4E10, and 10E8. However, eliciting these bNAbs by immunization with recombinant gp41 or MPER-derived peptides has been largely unsuccessful, possibly because of the low immunogenicity and the self-reactivity of these antigens. Here, we report the design and evaluation of a novel liposomal vaccine platform that incorporates MPER peptides and the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) as an adjuvant.

Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary hospital in Spain, comparing two periods: from March to April 2020, when a mixed ICU team was formed, and from May to June 2020, when the usual ICU team was restored. The primary outcome was ICU mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospital mortality, length of stay, ventilator-free days, and compliance with quality indicators. Results: A total of 136 patients were admitted to the ICU during the study period, 63 in the mixed team period and 73 in the usual team period. The baseline characteristics and severity of illness were similar between the groups. ICU mortality was 33.3% in the mixed team period and 15.1% in the usual team period (p=0.01). Hospital mortality was 39.7% and 19.2%, respectively (p=0.004). The mixed team period was associated with a lower number of ventilator-free days (9 vs 16, p<0.001) and a longer ICU length of stay (15 vs 10 days, p=0.002). The compliance with quality indicators, such as daily interruption of sedation, spontaneous breathing trials, and prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia, was significantly higher in the usual team period. Conclusion: The involvement of non-intensivists in the management of COVID-19 patients in the ICU, although necessary during the surge of the pandemic, may have a detrimental effect on the clinical outcomes and quality of care.

Env is a highly variable and complex protein that undergoes extensive post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and disulfide bond formation, which affect its folding, processing, and antigenicity. Env is synthesized as a precursor protein (gp160) that is cleaved by cellular proteases into two subunits: the surface unit (gp120) and the transmembrane unit (gp41). The gp120 subunit binds to the primary receptor CD4 and the co-receptor CCR5 or CXCR4, while the gp41 subunit facilitates the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The interaction of Env with the receptors triggers conformational changes in Env that expose the fusion peptide of gp41 and allow its insertion into the target cell membrane. The fusion peptide then forms a six-helix bundle structure that brings the viral and cellular membranes closer together and enables their fusion. The mechanism of HIV-1 entry and its inhibition by various agents have been studied extensively, but the molecular details of Env structure, function, and evolution are still not fully elucidated.

One of the possible ways that the gut microbiota may modulate host responses is through the production of metabolites that can affect various cellular processes, such as inflammation, immunity, metabolism, and gene expression. Among these metabolites, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the most abundant and have been shown to exert beneficial effects on host health.

The gp120 subunit binds to the host cell receptor CD4 and the coreceptor CCR5 or CXCR4, triggering conformational changes in gp41 that lead to membrane fusion.

One potential way to modulate the gut microbiota is by using prebiotics, dietary compounds that selectively stimulate the growth and/or activity of beneficial microbes. However, the effects of prebiotics on the gut microbiota and host metabolism are often inconsistent and vary depending on the individual. Methods: We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the effects of two prebiotics, galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) and inulin, on the gut microbiota composition and function, as well as host metabolic and inflammatory markers, in 90 healthy adults. We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metaproteomics, and metabolomics to characterize the gut microbiota, and measured plasma lipids, glucose, insulin, cytokines, and fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as outcomes. We also assessed the influence of the participants' baseline microbiota on the prebiotic response. Results: Both GOS and inulin significantly increased the abundance and diversity of bifidobacteria, but had distinct effects on other microbial groups. GOS reduced the abundance of pro-inflammatory Proteobacteria, while inulin increased the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria. Metaproteomics and metabolomics revealed that GOS and inulin also had different effects on the gut microbiota functionality, especially on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. GOS and inulin improved some host metabolic markers, such as lowering total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, but these effects were not associated with changes in the gut microbiota. Interestingly, we found that the baseline microbiota composition and function influenced the prebiotic response, as participants with lower bifidobacteria levels or higher proteolytic activity at baseline showed greater changes after prebiotic intake. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that prebiotics have selective and differential effects on the gut microbiota composition and function, and that these effects are modulated by the baseline microbiota.

These devices, collectively termed as neural nanobots, could offer unprecedented opportunities for exploring and manipulating neural processes with high precision and specificity. In this review, we provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art and future prospects of neural nanobots, focusing on their potential applications for brain mapping, neural decoding and neuroprosthetics. We also discuss the main technical and ethical challenges that need to be addressed before neural nanobots can become a reality.", "output": "\n\nSome possible titles based on the provided paragraph are:\n\n- Neural nanobots: a novel approach for brain mapping, decoding and prosthetics\n- Exploring and manipulating brain activity with neural nanobots: current advances and future challenges\n- Nanoscale devices for interfacing with neural cells: applications and implications for neuroscience\n- Neural nanobots: opportunities and obstacles for understanding and enhancing brain function\n- From molecules to networks: neural nanobots as a tool for multi-level brain imaging and modulation", "evaluation": 1}, {"input": "The human gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem that plays a key role in health and disease. Alterations in the gut microbiota composition and function have been associated with various chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease.

Env is composed of a surface subunit (gp120) and a transmembrane subunit (gp41) that mediate viral entry into host cells. The gp41 subunit contains a highly conserved membrane-proximal external region (MPER) that is involved in membrane fusion and is recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies. However, the structure and function of the MPER in the context of the native Env trimer are poorly understood. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a soluble Env trimer with an intact MPER and compare it with structures of Env trimers with truncated or modified MPERs.

Despite intensive multimodal therapy, the survival rate for high-risk neuroblastoma patients remains poor, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic strategies. One promising approach is the use of oncolytic viruses, which selectively infect and kill tumor cells while sparing normal cells. However, the efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy is often limited by the antiviral immune response and the tumor microenvironment. Methods-In this study, we evaluated the oncolytic potential of a novel chimeric virus, VSV-IFN\u03b2-NIS, which combines the oncolytic activity of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with the expression of human interferon beta (IFN\u03b2) and the human sodium iodide symporter (NIS). IFN\u03b2 enhances the safety and immunogenicity of the virus, while NIS enables non-invasive imaging and radiovirotherapy with 131I. We tested the cytotoxicity, biodistribution, and therapeutic efficacy of VSV-IFN\u03b2-NIS in neuroblastoma cell lines, patient-derived xenografts, and syngeneic models of neuroblastoma. Results-We found that VSV-IFN\u03b2-NIS efficiently infected and killed neuroblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo, with minimal toxicity to normal cells and organs. VSV-IFN\u03b2-NIS exhibited a favorable biodistribution pattern, with high tumor-to-normal tissue ratios. VSV-IFN\u03b2-NIS significantly improved the survival of mice bearing neuroblastoma xenografts and syngeneic tumors, and this effect was enhanced by combination with 131I and checkpoint blockade antibodies. VSV-IFN\u03b2-NIS induced immunogenic cell death and stimulated antitumor immunity, as evidenced by increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells in the tumor microenvironment. Conclusion-VSV-IFN\u03b2-NIS is a potent and safe oncolytic virus that can be used for non-invasive imaging and radiovirotherapy of neuroblastoma. VSV-IFN\u03b2-NIS elicits a robust antitumor immune response that can be further augmented by combination with immunotherapy.

In this study, we randomly assigned 60 healthy older adults to one of four conditions: listening to classical music, rock music, white noise, or silence, while performing a battery of cognitive tests. We measured their performance on tasks of verbal fluency, digit span, Stroop, and Raven's matrices. We also assessed their mood and musical preference before and after the intervention. We hypothesized that listening to music would improve cognitive performance compared to white noise or silence, and that the type of music would interact with the individual's musical preference and mood.

However, the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota communicates with the host brain remain poorly understood. One potential pathway is through the production of microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), that can modulate the activity of neurons and glia in the central nervous system. Methods: In this review, we summarize the current evidence on the effects of SCFAs on brain function and behavior, focusing on the molecular and cellular pathways involved. We also discuss the limitations and challenges of existing studies, and propose directions for future research. Results: SCFAs can affect brain function and behavior through various mechanisms, including the activation of SCFA receptors, the modulation of the blood-brain barrier, the alteration of neurotransmitter systems, the regulation of neuroinflammation, and the epigenetic modification of gene expression. SCFAs have been shown to influence several behavioral and cognitive processes, such as learning and memory, anxiety, depression, social interaction, and appetite control. However, the evidence is often inconsistent or contradictory, and the dose, timing, and route of administration of SCFAs are critical factors that need to be carefully controlled. Conclusions: SCFAs are promising candidates for mediating the gut-brain axis, but more rigorous and comprehensive studies are needed to elucidate their role and mechanisms in brain function and behavior.

Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota has been associated with various disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, diabetes, and cancer. However, the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota modulates host physiology and pathology are not fully understood. One of the emerging aspects of gut microbiota research is the interaction between the gut microbiota and the host circadian clock. The circadian clock is an endogenous system that regulates various physiological and behavioral processes in a 24-hour cycle. The circadian clock consists of a central pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus and peripheral oscillators in various tissues and organs, including the gut. The circadian clock and the gut microbiota are bidirectionally connected and mutually influence each other. The gut microbiota exhibits diurnal variations in composition and function, and can affect the circadian rhythm of the host through the production of metabolites and modulation of immune responses. Conversely, the circadian clock can shape the gut microbiota by altering the host feeding behavior, intestinal motility, secretion, and immunity. Disruption of the circadian clock or the gut microbiota can lead to metabolic and inflammatory disorders. Therefore, understanding the interplay between the circadian clock and the gut microbiota may provide novel insights into the prevention and treatment of various diseases.

However, the mechanisms by which diet shapes the gut microbial community and how this affects host-microbe interactions are still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of a high-fiber diet (HFD) and a low-fiber diet (LFD) on the gut microbiota and host physiology in a mouse model. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were fed either a HFD or a LFD for four weeks, and their fecal microbiota, body weight, glucose tolerance, intestinal morphology, and gene expression were analyzed. Results: The HFD increased the diversity and richness of the gut microbiota, and induced a shift in the relative abundance of bacterial taxa, favoring the expansion of fiber-degrading and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria. The HFD also improved glucose tolerance, reduced body weight gain, and enhanced intestinal barrier function and immune regulation. These effects were associated with increased SCFA levels and altered expression of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, inflammation, and tight junctions in the colon. In contrast, the LFD reduced the diversity and richness of the gut microbiota, and increased the abundance of bacteria with potential pathogenic features. The LFD also impaired glucose tolerance, increased body weight gain, and disrupted intestinal barrier function and immune regulation. These effects were associated with decreased SCFA levels and altered expression of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, inflammation, and tight junctions in the colon.

We evaluated the cytotoxicity of these compounds against four human cancer cell lines (MCF-7, A549, HepG2, and HCT116) and one normal cell line (HEK293) using the MTT assay. The structure-activity relationship analysis revealed that the introduction of a nitro group at the 4'-position of the B ring and a methoxy group at the 3-position of the A ring significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of the flavonoid derivatives.

HIV-1 infection is characterized by a progressive depletion of CD4+ T cells, which impairs the immune system and renders the host susceptible to opportunistic infections and malignancies. The viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) is the sole target of neutralizing antibodies and a major determinant of viral fitness and pathogenesis. Env is a trimeric complex composed of three gp120 and three gp41 subunits, which mediates viral entry into host cells by binding to the CD4 receptor and a chemokine coreceptor, either CCR5 or CXCR4. Env is highly variable and undergoes extensive glycosylation, which helps the virus to evade the host immune response. However, some broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) have been isolated from HIV-1-infected individuals, which can recognize conserved epitopes on Env and inhibit a wide range of viral strains. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of Env function and antibody recognition is crucial for the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics against HIV-1. Methods: In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the structure, function, diversity, and evolution of HIV-1 Env, as well as the strategies and challenges for eliciting and engineering bNAbs.

The rapid spread and high mortality of COVID-19 have highlighted the urgent need for effective antiviral therapies and vaccines. However, the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis are still poorly understood. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the structure, replication, and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, as well as its interaction with the host immune system. We also discuss the potential targets and strategies for the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Results: SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus. It has four structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), and several accessory proteins. The S protein mediates the attachment and entry of the virus into host cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The viral RNA is then released into the cytoplasm and translated into two large polyproteins, which are cleaved by viral and host proteases into 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) that form the replication-transcription complex (RTC). The RTC synthesizes genomic and subgenomic RNAs, which are used for the production of viral proteins and progeny virions. The assembly and release of virions occur at the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). SARS-CoV-2 has a high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV and bat coronaviruses, but also exhibits some distinct features, such as a furin cleavage site at the S protein and a longer open reading frame 8 (ORF8). SARS-CoV-2 can evade the host innate immune response by interfering with the recognition and signaling of viral RNA, and by modulating the expression and function of interferons (IFNs) and cytokines. SARS-CoV-2 infection can also induce a hyperinflammatory response, known as a cytokine storm, that causes tissue damage and organ failure. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious and pathogenic virus that poses a great challenge to the global health system.

While vaccines and therapeutics are being developed to combat the virus, there is a need for rapid and accurate diagnostic tools to identify and isolate infected individuals.

Methods: In this study, we propose a novel approach for COVID-19 diagnosis based on the analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath. VOCs are low-molecular-weight molecules that reflect the metabolic state of the body and can serve as biomarkers for various diseases. We collected breath samples from 50 confirmed COVID-19 patients and 50 healthy controls, and analyzed them using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). We then applied machine learning techniques to identify the VOCs that discriminate between COVID-19 and healthy samples, and to build a classification model for diagnosis. Results: We identified 12 VOCs that were significantly different between COVID-19 and healthy samples, with p-values ranging from 0.001 to 0.04. These VOCs included aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, and hydrocarbons, which may be related to oxidative stress, inflammation, and lipid peroxidation induced by COVID-19. Using these VOCs as features, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) classifier that achieved an accuracy of 92%, a sensitivity of 94%, and a specificity of 90% for COVID-19 diagnosis.

The viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) is the sole target of neutralizing antibodies and a major determinant of viral fitness and pathogenesis. Env is a trimeric complex composed of three gp120 subunits that bind to the CD4 receptor and a coreceptor (usually CCR5 or CXCR4) on the target cell, and three gp41 subunits that mediate membrane fusion. Env undergoes conformational changes upon receptor binding, exposing transiently the highly conserved fusion peptide (FP) at the N-terminus of gp41, which inserts into the target cell membrane and initiates the fusion process. The FP is a 20-amino acid hydrophobic region that is essential for viral entry and infectivity. However, the structure and dynamics of the FP in the context of the native Env trimer are poorly understood. In this study, we used site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to probe the structure and mobility of the FP in Env trimers expressed on the surface of pseudoviruses.

We also observed that the FP is highly flexible and exhibits fast rotational motion, suggesting that it can scan the target cell membrane for optimal insertion sites. Furthermore, we compared the FP dynamics between CCR5- and CXCR4-tropic Env trimers and found no significant differences, indicating that the FP conformation and mobility are independent of the coreceptor usage.

Blood samples were collected to measure cortisol, adrenaline, noradrenaline, and immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to assess the patients' anxiety levels. The results showed that the relaxing music group had significantly lower cortisol, adrenaline, noradrenaline, and anxiety levels than the other two groups. The rhythmic music group had significantly higher IgA levels than the no music group. The no music group had the highest stress and anxiety levels and the lowest IgA levels.

The etiology of ASD is complex and involves both genetic and environmental factors. Several studies have suggested that maternal infection during pregnancy may increase the risk of ASD in offspring, possibly through the activation of inflammatory pathways that affect fetal brain development. However, the evidence for this association is inconsistent and the mechanisms are poorly understood. Objective: We aimed to systematically review and meta-analyze the association between maternal infection during pregnancy and ASD risk in offspring, and to explore the potential role of inflammation as a mediator or moderator of this relationship. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science for observational studies that reported on the association between maternal infection (bacterial, viral, or parasitic) during pregnancy and ASD in offspring. We extracted data on study characteristics, infection types, exposure and outcome assessment, confounding adjustment, and effect estimates. We pooled the effect estimates using random-effects meta-analysis and assessed the heterogeneity and publication bias. We also performed subgroup and sensitivity analyses to explore the sources of heterogeneity and the robustness of the results. Results: We included 24 studies with a total of 6,148,623 participants, of which 164,174 were diagnosed with ASD. The pooled odds ratio (OR) for the association between any maternal infection during pregnancy and ASD in offspring was 1.30 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10-1.54), with moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 59.3%) and no publication bias. The association was stronger for bacterial infections (OR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.18-2.11) than for viral infections (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 0.99-1.45), and for infections in the second (OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.09-1.85) and third (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.08-1.74) trimesters than for infections in the first trimester (OR = 1.09, 95% CI: 0.86-1.38). The association was also stronger for studies that used hospital-based registers (OR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.24-1.82) than for studies that used population-based registers (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.91-1.38), and for studies that adjusted for more confounders (OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.16-1.69) than for studies that adjusted for fewer confounders (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 0.94-1.43). Only four studies measured maternal inflammatory markers during pregnancy, and none of them found a significant mediation or moderation effect of inflammation on the association between maternal infection and ASD. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis suggests that maternal infection during pregnancy is associated with a modestly increased risk of ASD in offspring, especially for bacterial infections and infections in the later stages of pregnancy.

Aim: To investigate the effects of dietary fiber supplementation on the gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, and host metabolic parameters in healthy adults. Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial with 40 healthy adults who received either 10 g/day of soluble corn fiber (SCF) or maltodextrin (placebo) for 4 weeks, with a 4-week washout period between interventions. Fecal samples were collected at baseline and at the end of each intervention period, and analyzed for microbiota composition by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and SCFA concentrations by gas chromatography. Blood samples were collected at the same time points and analyzed for glucose, insulin, lipids, and inflammatory markers by standard methods. Results: SCF supplementation significantly increased the abundance of Bifidobacterium and Roseburia, two major SCFA-producing genera, compared to placebo. SCF also significantly increased the fecal concentrations of acetate, propionate, and butyrate, the main SCFA produced by the gut microbiota. SCF improved several metabolic parameters, including reducing fasting glucose, insulin, and triglyceride levels, and increasing insulin sensitivity and HDL-cholesterol levels, compared to placebo. SCF also reduced the levels of inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein and interleukin-6, compared to placebo.

In this study, we used a phage display library to screen for peptides that mimic the CD4-induced (CD4i) epitopes on gp120, which are exposed after CD4 binding and are recognized by several bNAbs. We identified 12 peptides that bound to the CD4i-specific antibody 17b and competed with gp120 for 17b binding. The peptides also bound to other CD4i antibodies, such as 48d and E51, but not to non-CD4i antibodies, such as b12 and 2G12. The peptides showed sequence homology to different regions of gp120, including the bridging sheet, the V3 loop, and the C5 region. Some of the peptides also inhibited the infection of HIV-1 strains that use CCR5 or CXCR4 as coreceptors. Our results suggest that these peptides may represent novel mimotopes of the CD4i epitopes on gp120 and may have potential applications in HIV-1 diagnosis, therapy, and vaccine development.", "output": "\n\nSome possible titles based on the given paragraph are:\n\n- Identification of novel peptides that mimic CD4-induced epitopes on HIV-1 gp120 and inhibit viral infection\n- Peptide mimotopes of CD4-induced epitopes on HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein and their antiviral activity\n- Phage display screening for peptides that bind to CD4-induced antibodies and block HIV-1 entry\n- Novel CD4-induced epitope mimics on HIV-1 gp120 revealed by phage display and their neutralization potential", "evaluation": 1}, {"input": "The development of effective vaccines against neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), especially those caused by helminths, is hampered by the lack of suitable animal models that can capture the complex host-parasite interactions in humans.

Fiber posts were luted with a self-adhesive resin cement and sectioned into four slices per tooth. The push-out bond strength was measured using a universal testing machine.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the dentin surfaces after irrigation and the resin-dentin interfaces after the push-out test. The results showed that the bond strength values were significantly affected by the irrigant concentration (p < 0.001) and the root region (p < 0.001), but not by the interaction between these factors (p = 0.145). The 5.25% NaOCl group had the lowest bond strength, while the 2% CHX group had the highest bond strength among all groups.

HPV vaccines have been shown to be highly effective in preventing cervical lesions and cancer, but their uptake remains suboptimal in many countries. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices of young women regarding HPV infection, cervical cancer and HPV vaccination in Lebanon, a Middle Eastern country with a high burden of cervical cancer and low HPV vaccine coverage. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 600 female university students aged 18-26 years, recruited from six universities across Lebanon. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data on socio-demographic characteristics, HPV-related knowledge, attitudes towards HPV vaccination and practices of cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination. Results: The mean knowledge score of the participants was 11.4 out of 21, with only 18.5% having a high level of knowledge. The main sources of information about HPV were the internet (50.8%), friends (40.2%) and health care providers (HCPs) (26.7%). The majority of participants (85.7%) had a positive attitude towards HPV vaccination, and 44.8% intended to get vaccinated in the future. The main barriers to HPV vaccination were lack of information (46.9%), concerns about safety (33.8%) and cost (28.4%). Only 13.2% of the participants reported ever having a Pap smear test, and 4.7% reported ever receiving the HPV vaccine. Higher knowledge, positive attitude, older age, being sexually active, having a family history of cervical cancer, and receiving a recommendation from an HCP were associated with higher uptake of cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination. Conclusions: This study revealed a low level of knowledge and awareness of HPV infection, cervical cancer and HPV vaccination among young women in Lebanon, and identified several barriers and facilitators to cervical cancer prevention.

The etiology of ASD is complex and heterogeneous, involving both genetic and environmental factors. Several studies have suggested that maternal infection during pregnancy may increase the risk of ASD in offspring, possibly through inflammatory responses and immune activation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this association are poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to identify gene expression signatures associated with maternal infection and ASD diagnosis in a unique cohort of placental samples. Methods: We performed RNA sequencing on 24 placental samples from mothers who had bacterial or viral infection during pregnancy and their children who were diagnosed with ASD or typical development (TD). We used differential expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify genes and modules associated with infection status and ASD diagnosis. We also performed functional enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction network analysis to investigate the biological pathways and interactions of the identified genes and modules. Results: We found 131 differentially expressed genes between infection and no infection groups, and 286 differentially expressed genes between ASD and TD groups. WGCNA revealed two modules that were significantly correlated with infection status and ASD diagnosis, respectively. The infection-associated module was enriched for genes involved in immune response, inflammatory response, and defense response, while the ASD-associated module was enriched for genes related to neurodevelopment, synaptic transmission, and cell adhesion. Moreover, we identified hub genes and key regulators in each module, such as IL1B, IL6, and CXCL8 for the infection module, and NRXN1, NLGN1, and SHANK2 for the ASD module. Conclusion: Our study provides novel insights into the placental gene expression patterns associated with maternal infection and ASD diagnosis, and suggests possible molecular links between prenatal infection exposure and altered neurodevelopment in offspring. These findings may have implications for the early detection and prevention of ASD.", "output": "\n\nSome possible titles based on the provided paragraph are:\n\n- Placental gene expression signatures reveal immune and neurodevelopmental pathways associated with maternal infection and autism spectrum disorder\n- Maternal infection during pregnancy and autism spectrum disorder in offspring: A transcriptomic analysis of placental samples\n- RNA sequencing of placental tissue reveals differential expression and co-expression of genes related to infection and autism spectrum disorder\n- Immune and synaptic genes in the placenta are differentially expressed and co-expressed in response to maternal infection and autism spectrum disorder\n- How maternal infection and autism spectrum disorder affect placental gene expression: A RNA sequencing study", "evaluation": 1}, {"input": "The development of effective vaccines against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a major challenge for global health. One of the key obstacles is the high genetic diversity and variability of the virus, which allows it to escape from the host immune system and evade vaccine-induced responses. To overcome this problem, several strategies have been proposed to design vaccines that can elicit broad and potent neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against a wide range of HIV-1 variants. One of these strategies is based on the identification and characterization of conserved regions of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) that are recognized by bNAbs isolated from HIV-1-infected individuals. These regions, also known as broadly neutralizing epitopes (BNEs), are potential targets for vaccine design, as they represent the Achilles' heel of the virus. However, the identification and characterization of BNEs is not a trivial task, as they are often hidden or masked by various mechanisms of immune evasion, such as glycosylation, conformational changes, and sequence variation.

Molecular tests based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are the gold standard for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection, but they require specialized equipment and trained personnel, which limit their scalability and accessibility. Antigen tests, which detect viral proteins using lateral flow immunoassays, offer a promising alternative for point-of-care testing, as they are simple, inexpensive, and fast. However, antigen tests have lower sensitivity than RT-PCR and may produce false negative results, especially in asymptomatic or low viral load cases. In this study, we propose a novel approach to enhance the performance of antigen tests by combining them with a machine learning algorithm that analyzes the test images and provides a probabilistic score of infection. We developed a smartphone app that captures and processes the images of the antigen test strips and sends them to a cloud server, where a convolutional neural network (CNN) model classifies them as positive, negative, or invalid. The CNN model was trained and validated on a large dataset of antigen test images from different manufacturers, collected in various clinical settings and countries. We evaluated the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and robustness of our approach using both simulated and real-world data. Our results show that our approach can significantly improve the sensitivity of antigen tests without compromising their specificity, and can handle different types of tests, lighting conditions, and image qualities.

DNA methylation patterns can be measured in peripheral blood cells, which are more accessible than brain tissue. However, the relationship between blood and brain DNA methylation in ASD is unclear. Objective: To compare the DNA methylation profiles of ASD and typically developing (TD) individuals in blood and brain samples, and to identify potential epigenetic biomarkers of ASD. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that measured genome-wide DNA methylation in blood or brain samples from ASD and TD individuals. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases for relevant articles published until March 2020. We extracted the information on differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and differentially methylated probes (DMPs) from each study, and performed meta-analyses using a random-effects model. We also performed gene ontology and pathway analyses to explore the functional relevance of the identified DMRs and DMPs. Results: We included 24 studies in the systematic review, of which 14 were eligible for the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis of blood samples revealed 12 DMRs and 249 DMPs associated with ASD, while the meta-analysis of brain samples revealed 3 DMRs and 28 DMPs associated with ASD. The majority of the DMRs and DMPs showed hypomethylation in ASD compared to TD. The gene ontology and pathway analyses indicated that the DMRs and DMPs were involved in various biological processes and pathways related to ASD, such as synaptic transmission, neurogenesis, immune response, and oxidative stress.

Serum 25(OH)D, calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone, and urinary calcium and phosphorus were measured at baseline and every 3 months. BMD at the lumbar spine and femoral neck was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at baseline and 12 months. The results showed that serum 25(OH)D levels increased significantly in all vitamin D groups compared with placebo (P < 0.001), with the highest increase in the 1600 IU group (mean \u00b1 SD: 29.6 \u00b1 9.4 ng/mL). However, there was no significant difference in BMD changes among the four groups at either site. The incidence of adverse events, such as hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and nephrolithiasis, was similar among the groups. In conclusion, vitamin D supplementation at doses of 400-1600 IU/day for 12 months was effective and safe in increasing serum 25(OH)D levels in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, but did not result in significant changes in BMD.

One Health (OH) is an interdisciplinary approach that integrates human, animal, and environmental health to address complex health challenges such as AMR. However, there is a lack of consensus on how to operationalize and evaluate OH interventions in practice. This study aims to develop and apply a framework for assessing the implementation and outcomes of OH interventions to combat AMR in Southeast Asia. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review to identify existing frameworks and tools for designing, implementing, and evaluating OH interventions. We then synthesized the relevant elements into a comprehensive OH evaluation framework, which we applied to two case studies of OH interventions to combat AMR in Thailand and Vietnam. We collected data from multiple sources, including project documents, peer-reviewed publications, and interviews with key stakeholders. We used qualitative content analysis to assess the extent to which the interventions followed the OH principles and achieved the intended outputs and outcomes. Results: The OH evaluation framework consists of four domains: context, intervention, implementation, and outcomes. Each domain contains a set of criteria and indicators to measure the performance and impact of OH interventions. The application of the framework to the case studies revealed that both interventions addressed important AMR problems in the local context, engaged multiple sectors and stakeholders, and generated evidence and recommendations for policy and practice. However, the interventions also faced several challenges, such as limited resources, weak coordination, and lack of sustainability. The framework helped to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the interventions and to provide recommendations for improvement.

The RSV fusion (F) protein mediates viral entry into host cells and is a primary target for vaccine and drug development. The F protein consists of two disulfide-linked subunits, F1 and F2, and is present on the virion surface as a metastable prefusion form that undergoes a dramatic conformational change to a more stable postfusion form during viral infection. The prefusion F trimer is highly antigenic and elicits potent neutralizing antibodies, whereas the postfusion F is less immunogenic and induces lower levels of neutralizing antibodies. The prefusion F is also more prone to proteolytic cleavage, which can alter its antigenicity and trigger premature conformational changes. Therefore, characterization of the proteolytic susceptibility of RSV F is important for understanding its structure, function and immunogenicity. In this study, we used mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing to identify the cleavage sites of RSV F by different proteases, including trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, thermolysin and proteinase K. We found that the prefusion F was more sensitive to proteolysis than the postfusion F, and that the cleavage occurred mainly at the F2 subunit and the F1 N-terminus. We also determined the crystal structure of the thermolysin-cleaved prefusion F, which revealed a novel conformational state of the F protein, with the F2 subunit dissociated from the F1 trimer and the heptad repeat B region partially exposed.

In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the design, synthesis and evaluation of flavonoid-based nanosystems for cancer therapy. We discuss the advantages and challenges of different types of nanocarriers, such as liposomes, micelles, nanoparticles, nanogels and nanofibers, for delivering flavonoids to tumor sites.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can suppress viral replication and prevent disease progression, but it is not a cure and requires lifelong adherence. Moreover, ART is associated with adverse effects, drug resistance, and high costs. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop alternative strategies to eliminate HIV from infected individuals.

However, the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota influences host physiology and behavior are not fully understood. One potential link between the gut microbiota and the brain is the vagus nerve, which connects the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. The vagus nerve can transmit signals from the gut to the brain, and vice versa, modulating various aspects of gut function and brain activity. Objectives: In this review, we summarize the current evidence on the role of the vagus nerve in mediating the effects of the gut microbiota on host physiology and behavior, focusing on animal and human studies that have manipulated the gut microbiota (e.g., by antibiotics, probiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation) and/or the vagus nerve (e.g., by vagotomy or vagus nerve stimulation). We also discuss the possible mechanisms by which the gut microbiota and the vagus nerve interact, such as the production of neurotransmitters and short-chain fatty acids by gut bacteria, and the modulation of the immune and endocrine systems by the gut microbiota and the vagus nerve. Results: The gut microbiota and the vagus nerve are involved in a bidirectional communication that affects various domains of host physiology and behavior, such as food intake, pain perception, stress response, mood, memory, and social interaction. The vagus nerve is necessary for some, but not all, effects of the gut microbiota on the brain and behavior. Conversely, the gut microbiota can influence the structure and function of the vagus nerve. The interaction between the gut microbiota and the vagus nerve may involve multiple mechanisms, such as the regulation of inflammation, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and the neurotransmitter systems. Conclusion: The vagus nerve is an important mediator of the gut-brain axis, and a modulator of the gut microbiota-brain communication. Targeting the vagus nerve and/or the gut microbiota may offer novel therapeutic strategies for various disorders that involve the gut-brain axis, such as obesity, depression, autism, and Parkinson's disease.", "output": "\n\nSome possible titles based on the provided paragraph are:\n\n- The Vagus Nerve: A Key Link Between the Gut Microbiota and the Brain\n- How the Gut Microbiota and the Vagus Nerve Communicate and Affect Host Physiology and Behavior\n- Vagal Pathways of the Gut-Brain Axis: Mechanisms and Implications for Health and Disease\n- The Role of the Vagus Nerve in Mediating the Effects of the Gut Microbiota on the Central Nervous System\n- Gut Microbiota-Brain Interaction via the Vagus Nerve: Evidence, Mechanisms, and Therapeutic Potential", "evaluation": 1}, {"input": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of different doses of vitamin D supplementation on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.

Results: Shift workers had lower alpha diversity and higher beta diversity of the gut microbiota than non-shift workers, indicating a reduced richness and an increased variability of the microbial community. Shift workers also showed differential abundances of several taxa, including higher levels of Bacteroidetes and lower levels of Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia.

Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of probiotics versus placebo or no treatment on the gut microbiota and clinical outcomes in adults who received antibiotics. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov for eligible studies up to March 31, 2020. We extracted data on the characteristics of the participants, interventions, and outcomes, and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane tool. We performed random-effects meta-analyses and calculated the pooled mean difference (MD) or risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous and dichotomous outcomes, respectively. We also assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. Results: We included 63 RCTs with a total of 8,056 participants. The probiotics used in the trials were mainly Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, or Saccharomyces, alone or in combination, at doses ranging from 10^7 to 10^11 colony-forming units (CFU) per day. The duration of probiotic intervention varied from 5 to 49 days. The antibiotics used in the trials were mostly penicillins, cephalosporins, macrolides, or fluoroquinolones, for various indications, such as respiratory, urinary, or skin infections. The main outcomes were the changes in the gut microbiota composition, diversity, and function, as well as the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), and adverse events. The meta-analyses showed that probiotics significantly increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria, such as Lactobacillus (MD 0.36, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.53, I^2 = 86%, 18 trials) and Bifidobacterium (MD 0.25, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.38, I^2 = 74%, 16 trials), and decreased the abundance of potentially harmful bacteria, such as Enterobacteriaceae (MD -0.24, 95% CI -0.36 to -0.12, I^2 = 54%, 12 trials) and Clostridium (MD -0.16, 95% CI -0.28 to -0.04, I^2 = 68%, 9 trials), compared with placebo or no treatment. Probiotics also significantly increased the alpha diversity (MD 0.14, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.22, I^2 = 0%, 7 trials) and beta diversity (MD 0.11, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.18, I^2 = 0%, 5 trials) of the gut microbiota, indicating a higher richness and evenness of the microbial communities. Moreover, probiotics significantly enhanced the gut microbiota function, as measured by the levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate (MD 0.21, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.33, I^2 = 0%, 4 trials) and propionate (MD 0.19, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.31, I^2 = 0%, 4 trials), which have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. In terms of clinical outcomes, probiotics significantly reduced the risk of AAD (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.68, I^2 = 54%, 42 trials) and CDI (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.66, I^2 = 0%, 15 trials), compared with placebo or no treatment. The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one case of AAD and CDI was 13 and 42, respectively.

The metastable prefusion conformation of Env is stabilized by a network of intra- and inter-protomer interactions that are disrupted during the fusion process. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of a panel of human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that recognize a conserved epitope in the gp41 ectodomain close to the fusion peptide. These MAbs were derived from HIV-1-infected individuals and potently neutralized diverse HIV-1 strains. The MAbs bound to a helical region in the N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) of gp41 and prevented the formation of the six-helix bundle that drives membrane fusion. The MAbs also interfered with the exposure of the fusion peptide, suggesting that they inhibit a conformational change in Env that precedes the six-helix bundle formation. The epitope of these MAbs overlaps with the binding site of the broadly neutralizing antibody 10E8, which targets the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of gp41. However, the new MAbs did not compete with 10E8 and had a distinct angle of approach to Env.

The etiology of ASD is complex and multifactorial, involving both genetic and environmental factors. Recent advances in genomic technologies have enabled the identification of hundreds of genes associated with ASD, many of which are involved in synaptic function and neuronal connectivity. However, the molecular mechanisms by which these genes contribute to ASD pathophysiology remain poorly understood. One approach to elucidate the role of ASD genes is to generate animal models that recapitulate the genetic and phenotypic features of the disorder. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a vertebrate model organism that offers several advantages for studying ASD, such as high genetic tractability, conserved brain structure and function, and robust behavioral assays. Methods: In this review, we summarize the current state of zebrafish research on ASD, focusing on the generation and characterization of zebrafish models of ASD genes. We also discuss the potential applications of zebrafish models for drug discovery and personalized medicine. Results/Conclusions: Zebrafish models of ASD genes have revealed novel insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying ASD-related phenotypes, such as altered brain development, synaptic transmission, and social behavior.

One of the potential pathways is through the production of metabolites that can modulate the activity of various host cells and organs. Among these metabolites, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the most abundant and have been shown to exert beneficial effects on host metabolism, inflammation, and immunity. SCFAs are produced by the fermentation of dietary fibers and resistant starches by anaerobic bacteria in the colon. The main SCFAs are acetate, propionate, and butyrate, which have different biological functions and target tissues. SCFAs can act locally in the gut, where they regulate intestinal epithelial cell proliferation, differentiation, and barrier function, as well as immune cell development and function. SCFAs can also act systemically, where they modulate the activity of the liver, adipose tissue, pancreas, skeletal muscle, and brain. The effects of SCFAs are mediated by different mechanisms, including binding to G protein-coupled receptors, inhibiting histone deacetylases, and altering the expression of genes and microRNAs. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the production, transport, and mechanisms of action of SCFAs, and discuss their role in the regulation of host metabolism, inflammation, and immunity.

In this study, we investigated the effects of three flavonoids, quercetin, kaempferol, and apigenin, on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and explored the possible signaling pathways involved. We found that all three flavonoids inhibited the proliferation and viability of HCC cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, but quercetin was the most potent.

HIV infection is associated with chronic inflammation and oxidative stress, which contribute to the pathogenesis of AIDS and its complications. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can suppress viral replication and restore immune function, but it cannot eradicate the virus and has adverse effects. Therefore, there is a need for alternative or complementary strategies to modulate the immune system and reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in HIV-infected individuals. Objective: This review summarizes the current evidence on the potential role of natural products, such as plant extracts, phytochemicals, and dietary supplements, in modulating the immune system and reducing inflammation and oxidative stress in HIV infection. Methods: We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases for relevant articles published from January 2000 to December 2020, using the keywords \"HIV\" or \"AIDS\" and \"natural products\" or \"plant extracts\" or \"phytochemicals\" or \"dietary supplements\". We included studies that evaluated the effects of natural products on HIV replication, immune activation, cytokine production, oxidative stress, and antioxidant status in vitro, in vivo, or in clinical trials. Results: We identified 113 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The natural products evaluated in these studies included various plant extracts, such as green tea, curcumin, garlic, and propolis, as well as isolated phytochemicals, such as quercetin, resveratrol, and epigallocatechin gallate, and dietary supplements, such as probiotics, omega-3 fatty acids, and selenium. The majority of the studies reported beneficial effects of natural products on HIV replication, immune activation, cytokine production, oxidative stress, and antioxidant status, although some studies showed no effect or adverse effects. The mechanisms of action of natural products involved modulation of viral entry, reverse transcription, integration, transcription, and maturation, as well as inhibition of NF-kappaB, AP-1, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, suppression of pro-inflammatory and Th17 cytokines, induction of anti-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines, enhancement of natural killer and CD8+ T cell activity, restoration of CD4+ T cell count and function, reduction of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and upregulation of antioxidant enzymes and glutathione. Conclusion: Natural products may have potential as adjuvants to ART in HIV infection, as they can modulate the immune system and reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, which are associated with disease progression and complications.

Rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 is essential for controlling the spread of the virus and providing appropriate care to patients. However, the current gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), has several limitations, such as high cost, long turnaround time, and dependence on specialized equipment and reagents. Therefore, there is an urgent need for alternative diagnostic methods that are simple, rapid, inexpensive, and point-of-care. Methods: In this review, we summarize the current status and future prospects of various diagnostic methods for COVID-19, with a focus on serological tests and antigen detection tests. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method, as well as the challenges and opportunities for their development and implementation. Results: Serological tests and antigen detection tests are promising alternatives or complements to RT-PCR for COVID-19 diagnosis, as they can provide results within minutes to hours, require minimal equipment and training, and are suitable for mass screening and surveillance. However, these methods also have some drawbacks, such as lower sensitivity and specificity, cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses, and variability in antibody and antigen levels during the course of infection. Moreover, the interpretation and clinical implication of the test results need to be carefully considered in the context of the infection status, disease stage, and immune response of the individual. Conclusions: The development and evaluation of serological tests and antigen detection tests for COVID-19 diagnosis should be based on rigorous scientific evidence and standardized criteria. The availability and accessibility of these tests should be enhanced by addressing the regulatory, logistical, and ethical issues involved in their deployment.

Results: Antibiotics have diverse and complex effects on the gut microbiota, depending on the type, dose, and duration of antibiotic treatment, as well as the baseline characteristics of the host and the microbiota. Antibiotics can reduce the abundance and diversity of the gut microbiota, disrupt its metabolic and functional capabilities, and increase its susceptibility to colonization by pathogens and opportunists. These effects can persist for weeks, months, or even years after antibiotic cessation, and can have detrimental consequences for host health and disease, such as increased inflammation, impaired immunity, altered metabolism, and increased risk of infections and chronic diseases.

Computational methods have also facilitated the design and optimization of vaccine candidates, such as subunit vaccines, virus-like particles, and live attenuated vaccines, by taking into account various factors, such as antigen stability, immunogenicity, safety, and manufacturability. Moreover, computational modeling and simulation have been used to predict and evaluate the efficacy and impact of different vaccination strategies and scenarios.

The biofilm formation of S. mutans was assessed by crystal violet staining and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) after exposure to sub-MIC concentrations of propolis extract. The results showed that the MIC and MBC of propolis extract against S. mutans were 6.25% and 12.5%, respectively. Propolis extract at 0.78%, 1.56%, and 3.12% significantly reduced the biofilm biomass and altered the biofilm structure of S. mutans.

However, there is no consensus on how to define and measure resilience, and how to apply it to promote positive outcomes in different contexts. This article reviews the historical development and the current debates on resilience, and proposes a framework that integrates three dimensions of resilience: recovery, resistance, and transformation. Recovery refers to the capacity to return to a stable state after a disturbance; resistance refers to the ability to maintain functioning despite stress; and transformation involves the ability to change the system's structure and function in response to novel challenges.

Methods: We recruited 20 healthy volunteers (10 vegans and 10 omnivores) and collected fecal samples at baseline and after four weeks of dietary intervention. We performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the bacterial communities and analyzed the data using QIIME 2 and LEfSe. We also measured fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by gas chromatography and fecal pH by colorimetric assay. Results: We found that the vegan diet significantly increased the alpha diversity and altered the beta diversity of the gut microbiota compared to the omnivorous diet. The vegan diet enriched for several taxa, including Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Roseburia, and depleted for others, such as Alistipes, Ruminococcus, and Clostridium. The vegan diet also increased the relative abundance of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and decreased those involved in amino acid metabolism. Moreover, the vegan diet increased the fecal levels of SCFAs, especially acetate and propionate, and reduced the fecal pH.

Peptides are promising candidates for new antibiotics, as they can exhibit potent and broad-spectrum activity against various pathogens. However, the design of effective peptide antibiotics is challenging, as they need to balance several physicochemical properties, such as hydrophobicity, amphipathicity, and charge, to achieve both high activity and low toxicity. In this study, we applied a machine learning approach to discover novel peptide antibiotics from a large and diverse set of natural and synthetic peptides. We trained a random forest classifier to predict the antimicrobial activity of peptides based on their amino acid composition and molecular descriptors. The model achieved a high accuracy of 0.94 on a balanced test set, and was able to identify the most important features for antimicrobial activity. We then used the model to screen a virtual library of over 100,000 peptides and selected 20 candidates for experimental validation. Out of these, 18 peptides showed activity against at least one of the tested bacterial strains, and 10 peptides exhibited broad-spectrum activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

The etiology of ASD is complex and heterogeneous, involving both genetic and environmental factors. Recent advances in genomic technologies have enabled the identification of hundreds of genes associated with ASD, many of which are involved in synaptic function and neuronal connectivity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying ASD pathogenesis remain largely unknown. In this review, we summarize the current state of knowledge on the genetic basis of ASD, focusing on the role of synaptic genes and pathways implicated in ASD. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities for translating genetic findings into novel therapeutic strategies for ASD. Methods: We performed a literature search using PubMed and Google Scholar databases, using the keywords \"autism\", \"genetics\", \"synapse\", \"neurodevelopment\", and \"therapy\". We selected articles published in English from 2010 to 2020 that reported original research or reviews on the genetic and synaptic aspects of ASD. We also included some relevant articles published before 2010 that provided important background information. We critically appraised the articles and synthesized the main findings and conclusions. Results: We identified 127 articles that met our inclusion criteria and reviewed them in detail. We found that ASD is a highly polygenic and heterogeneous disorder, with both common and rare genetic variants contributing to its risk and phenotypic diversity. We also found that many ASD-associated genes converge on common synaptic pathways and processes, such as synaptic transmission, plasticity, and pruning, that are essential for normal brain development and function. Furthermore, we found that several animal and cellular models of ASD have been developed to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms of ASD and to test potential therapeutic interventions. We highlighted some promising therapeutic approaches that target synaptic dysfunction in ASD, such as modulating neurotransmitter systems, enhancing synaptic maturation and stability, and restoring synaptic homeostasis.

The primary outcome was stroke or systemic embolism. The secondary outcomes included ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, death, and major bleeding. Results: A total of 3,623 patients (20%) had a history of stroke or TIA at baseline. These patients had higher rates of the primary outcome than those without prior stroke or TIA (2.87% vs 1.44% per year, respectively; p<0.001). Compared with warfarin, dabigatran 150 mg reduced the primary outcome in patients with prior stroke or TIA (hazard ratio [HR] 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60-0.99, p=0.04), but not in those without (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.72-1.03, p=0.11; p for interaction=0.40). Dabigatran 110 mg did not significantly reduce the primary outcome in either subgroup. Both doses of dabigatran reduced hemorrhagic stroke and major bleeding in patients with and without prior stroke or TIA, with no significant heterogeneity. Conclusions: In patients with NVAF and a history of stroke or TIA, dabigatran 150 mg twice daily was more effective than warfarin in preventing stroke or systemic embolism, without increasing the risk of major bleeding. Dabigatran may be a preferable alternative to warfarin for secondary prevention in this high-risk population.", "output": "\n\nSome possible titles based on the provided paragraph are:\n\n- Dabigatran versus warfarin for secondary prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation and prior stroke or TIA: a subgroup analysis of the RE-LY trial\n- Efficacy and safety of dabigatran 150 mg in preventing recurrent stroke or systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation patients with a history of cerebrovascular events: a post-hoc analysis of the RE-LY trial\n- Dabigatran 150 mg reduces stroke or systemic embolism more than warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and previous stroke or TIA: results from the RE-LY trial\n- A comparison of dabigatran and warfarin for stroke or systemic embolism prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation and prior stroke or TIA: a RE-LY trial subgroup analysis\n- The effect of dabigatran on stroke or systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation and a history of stroke or TIA: a post-hoc analysis of the RE-LY trial", "evaluation": 1}, {"input": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different types of music on the cognitive performance and mood of older adults.

Alterations in the gut microbial composition and function have been associated with various chronic inflammatory and metabolic disorders. However, the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota influences host immunity and metabolism are not fully understood. One potential mediator is the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are the main fermentation products of the gut bacteria. SCFAs have been shown to modulate host immune responses, gene expression, and cellular signaling pathways. However, the effects of SCFAs on host lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis are less clear. Methods: In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the role of SCFAs in regulating host lipid metabolism and energy balance. We discuss the molecular mechanisms by which SCFAs interact with host receptors, transporters, and transcription factors involved in lipid synthesis, oxidation, and storage. We also highlight the potential benefits and challenges of manipulating SCFAs as a therapeutic strategy for metabolic disorders. Results: SCFAs have diverse and complex effects on host lipid metabolism and energy balance. Depending on the dose, route, and target tissue, SCFAs can either promote or inhibit lipid synthesis, oxidation, and storage. SCFAs can also influence energy expenditure, appetite, and satiety through their effects on the central nervous system and the endocrine system. Moreover, SCFAs can modulate the gut barrier function and the gut hormone secretion, which may affect the host metabolic status. Conclusion: SCFAs are important mediators of the gut microbiota-host interaction, with multiple implications for host lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. Manipulating SCFAs, either by dietary interventions, probiotics, prebiotics, or pharmacological agents, may offer novel opportunities for the prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders.

One of the possible ways is through the production of metabolites that can modulate the activity of various host cells and organs. Among these metabolites, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the most abundant and have been shown to exert beneficial effects on host metabolism, immunity, and inflammation.

SCFAs can act as energy sources for colonocytes, regulate intestinal motility and barrier function, modulate the expression of genes and proteins involved in metabolic and inflammatory pathways, and affect the differentiation and function of immune cells. Moreover, SCFAs can cross the epithelial barrier and enter the systemic circulation, where they can interact with different receptors and transporters expressed by various tissues and organs, such as the liver, adipose tissue, pancreas, brain, and heart.

One potential way to modulate the gut microbiota is by using prebiotics, dietary compounds that selectively stimulate the growth and/or activity of beneficial microbes. However, the effects of prebiotics on the gut microbiota and host metabolism are often inconsistent and depend on various factors, such as the type and dose of prebiotic, the duration of intervention, and the baseline characteristics of the subjects. Methods: In this review, we summarize the current evidence on the effects of prebiotics on the gut microbiota and host metabolism in healthy and diseased populations, focusing on human intervention studies. We also discuss the challenges and limitations of prebiotic research, such as the lack of standardized methods for prebiotic selection, characterization, and delivery, the inter-individual variability in prebiotic responses, and the confounding effects of diet and other environmental factors. Results: Prebiotics can modulate the gut microbiota composition and function, as well as several metabolic outcomes, such as glucose, lipid, and energy homeostasis, inflammation, and immune regulation. However, the magnitude and direction of these effects are highly variable and depend on the specific prebiotic, dose, and duration used, as well as the health status, genetics, and lifestyle of the subjects. Moreover, prebiotics may have adverse effects in some cases, such as gastrointestinal discomfort, increased infection risk, and impaired mineral absorption. Conclusion: Prebiotics are promising dietary tools to manipulate the gut microbiota and improve host health, but more research is needed to establish their optimal use and safety in different populations and conditions.

Env is composed of a surface subunit (gp120) and a transmembrane subunit (gp41) that mediate viral entry by binding to the CD4 receptor and a coreceptor, usually CCR5 or CXCR4. Env is highly variable and evolves rapidly to escape host immune responses. However, some regions of Env are more conserved and contain epitopes recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) isolated from HIV-1-infected individuals. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the genetic diversity and structural features of Env from different HIV-1 subtypes and co-receptor usage groups. We used bioinformatics tools to align, phylogenetically classify, and model the three-dimensional structures of 664 Env sequences obtained from the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database. We also predicted the co-receptor usage, the epitope mapping, and the antigenicity of each Env sequence. Our results revealed that the global diversity of Env is high, but some regions, such as the fusion peptide, the CD4 binding site, and the membrane proximal external region, are more conserved than others. We also found that the co-receptor usage of Env is associated with distinct amino acid patterns in the variable regions and the gp41 subunit. Furthermore, we identified several novel potential bNAb epitopes that are present in more than 90% of the Env sequences analyzed. These epitopes are located in the gp120 outer domain, the gp120-gp41 interface, and the gp41 ectodomain.

One potential way to modulate the gut microbiota is through dietary interventions, such as prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics. However, the effects of these interventions on the gut microbiota composition and function, as well as on the host immune system and metabolism, are not fully elucidated. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the impact of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics on the gut microbiota, immune markers, and metabolic outcomes in adults. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that reported changes in the gut microbiota, immune markers, or metabolic outcomes after prebiotic, probiotic, or synbiotic interventions in healthy or diseased adults. We performed random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the pooled effect sizes and heterogeneity across studies. We also assessed the risk of bias and the quality of evidence using the Cochrane tool and the GRADE approach, respectively. Results: We included 63 RCTs with a total of 4,753 participants. Prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics significantly increased the abundance of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in the gut, with moderate to high quality of evidence. Prebiotics also increased the abundance of faecalibacteria and butyrate-producing bacteria, while probiotics decreased the abundance of enterobacteria and clostridia. Synbiotics had mixed effects on other bacterial groups, depending on the combination of prebiotics and probiotics used. Prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics also significantly modulated several immune markers, such as cytokines, immunoglobulins, and leukocytes, with low to moderate quality of evidence. However, the direction and magnitude of these effects varied across studies and depended on the type and dose of intervention, the duration of treatment, and the health status of the participants. The effects of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics on metabolic outcomes, such as glucose, lipid, and bile acid metabolism, were inconsistent and inconclusive, with very low to low quality of evidence.

However, the effects of different types of dietary fibre on the gut microbiota and the host metabolism are not well understood. We aimed to compare the effects of two types of arabinoxylan (AX), a major component of cereal fibre, on the gut microbiota and the host metabolic profile in a randomized crossover trial. Methods: Twenty healthy adults consumed two types of AX-enriched bread, made from either wheat (WB-AX) or rye (RB-AX) flour, providing 10.4 g and 10.1 g of AX per day, respectively, for 3 weeks, separated by a 4-week washout period. Fecal samples were collected before and after each intervention and analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics. Plasma samples were also collected at the end of each intervention and analyzed by targeted metabolomics. Results: Both types of AX-enriched bread significantly increased the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium and Prevotella, and decreased that of Ruminococcus and Clostridium, compared to baseline. However, WB-AX had a stronger effect on increasing Bifidobacterium and decreasing Ruminococcus than RB-AX. The fecal metabolome showed significant changes in several metabolites related to carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, as well as bile acids, after both interventions. WB-AX induced higher levels of lactate, butyrate, and propionate, while RB-AX increased succinate and 4-hydroxyphenylacetate. The plasma metabolome revealed significant changes in the levels of glucose, amino acids, and lipids after both interventions, with WB-AX showing a more pronounced effect on lowering glucose and raising branched-chain amino acids than RB-AX. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that AX-enriched bread can modulate the gut microbiota and the host metabolism in a type-specific manner, with wheat AX having a stronger impact than rye AX. These findings suggest that the source and structure of AX may influence its prebiotic potential and its metabolic benefits. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03441212.

The results showed that the bond strength values were significantly influenced by both the irrigant type and the root region (p<0.001). The 5.25% NaOCl group presented the lowest bond strength, while the 2% CHX group showed the highest bond strength among the irrigants. The cervical region had higher bond strength than the middle and apical regions. The most common failure mode was adhesive between dentin and cement.

In this study, we constructed and evaluated a novel multivalent DNA vaccine that encodes 20 conserved regions from the HIV-1 proteome, designated as HIV-1 CONSERV. The immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the HIV-1 CONSERV vaccine were tested in mice and rhesus macaques, using DNA prime and recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) boost regimens. The results showed that the HIV-1 CONSERV vaccine induced robust and polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in both species, with broad cross-reactivity against diverse HIV-1 isolates. Moreover, the vaccine conferred partial protection against intrarectal challenge with a heterologous simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) in macaques, as evidenced by reduced plasma viral load and preserved CD4+ T cell counts in the peripheral blood and gut mucosa.

The composition and function of the gut microbiota are influenced by multiple factors, including diet, drugs, environment, host genetics, and immune system. Among these factors, diet is one of the most important and modifiable determinants of the gut microbiota, as it provides substrates for microbial fermentation and modulates the intestinal pH, bile acid pool, and mucosal barrier. Dietary interventions, such as prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, and dietary fiber, have been shown to alter the gut microbiota in beneficial ways, such as increasing the abundance and diversity of beneficial microbes, enhancing the production of short-chain fatty acids, and improving the intestinal barrier function. However, the effects of dietary interventions on the gut microbiota are not uniform and depend on several factors, such as the baseline microbiota, the type and dose of the intervention, the duration of the intervention, and the interaction with other dietary components. Moreover, the gut microbiota is not only a passive recipient of dietary inputs, but also an active player that can influence the host's metabolism, appetite, and food preferences. Therefore, a better understanding of the bidirectional interactions between diet and the gut microbiota is essential for developing personalized dietary strategies to modulate the gut microbiota and improve health outcomes.

However, the massive and unstructured nature of Twitter data poses challenges for natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic detection, and summarization. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for Twitter text summarization based on graph-based ranking algorithms and deep neural networks. Methods: We first construct a tweet similarity graph by computing the cosine similarity between the embeddings of tweets generated by a pre-trained BERT model. Then, we apply a graph-based ranking algorithm, such as TextRank or LexRank, to score the tweets based on their centrality and relevance. Next, we select the top-ranked tweets and use a sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism to generate a summary that captures the main points and sentiments of the original tweets. Finally, we evaluate our framework on two Twitter datasets related to COVID-19 and US politics, and compare it with several baselines and existing methods. Results: Our experimental results show that our framework outperforms the baselines and existing methods in terms of ROUGE scores and human evaluation. Moreover, our framework is able to generate concise and informative summaries that reflect the opinions and emotions of the Twitter users. Conclusion: We have presented a novel framework for Twitter text summarization that combines graph-based ranking algorithms and deep neural networks. Our framework can effectively leverage the semantic and structural information of tweets to produce high-quality summaries.

RSV infection can result in severe bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and even death. There is currently no licensed vaccine or specific antiviral therapy for RSV. The RSV fusion (F) protein mediates the fusion of the viral and host cell membranes, and is a key target for vaccine and antiviral development. The F protein undergoes a series of conformational changes during the fusion process, from a metastable prefusion state to a highly stable postfusion state. The prefusion F protein is more immunogenic and elicits more potent neutralizing antibodies than the postfusion F protein.

The etiology of ASD is complex and multifactorial, involving both genetic and environmental factors. Recent advances in genomic technologies have enabled the identification of hundreds of genes associated with ASD, many of which are involved in synaptic function and neuronal connectivity. However, the molecular mechanisms by which these genes contribute to ASD pathophysiology remain poorly understood. Methods: In this review, we summarize the current state of knowledge on the genetic basis of ASD, focusing on the synaptic genes that have been implicated in ASD through various approaches, such as linkage analysis, genome-wide association studies, copy number variation analysis, exome sequencing, and functional studies. We also discuss the potential roles of these genes in synaptic development, plasticity, and signaling, as well as the challenges and opportunities for future research. Results/Conclusions: Synaptic genes associated with ASD are involved in various aspects of synaptic function, such as neurotransmitter release, receptor trafficking, synaptic vesicle recycling, cytoskeletal dynamics, and synaptic pruning. Dysregulation of these genes may lead to abnormal synaptic structure and function, and ultimately affect neuronal connectivity and circuitry. Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of synaptic dysfunction in ASD may provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of this disorder and facilitate the development of biomarkers and therapeutic interventions.", "output": "\n\nSome possible titles based on the provided paragraph are:\n\n- Synaptic genes and autism spectrum disorder: from genetics to mechanisms\n- The role of synaptic dysfunction in the etiology and pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder\n- How synaptic genes affect neuronal connectivity and behavior in autism spectrum disorder\n- Genetic and synaptic basis of autism spectrum disorder: current advances and challenges\n- Synaptic genes in autism spectrum disorder: implications for synaptic development, plasticity, and signaling", "evaluation": 1}, {"input": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different types of music on the cognitive performance of healthy older adults.

One of the strategies to overcome this challenge is to design vaccines that elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that can recognize and block a wide range of HIV-1 variants.

Env is composed of a surface subunit (gp120) and a transmembrane subunit (gp41) that mediate viral entry by binding to the CD4 receptor and a coreceptor, usually CCR5 or CXCR4, on the host cell. Env undergoes conformational changes during the entry process, exposing transiently the gp41 fusion peptide (FP) and the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) region, which are involved in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes. These regions are normally hidden by the gp120 subunit and the gp41 ectodomain, and are considered as potential targets for neutralizing antibodies and fusion inhibitors. However, the structural and functional characterization of these regions is challenging due to their high flexibility and heterogeneity. In this study, we used a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), circular dichroism (CD), and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) techniques to investigate the conformational properties and the binding interactions of synthetic peptides corresponding to the FP and HR1 regions of HIV-1 Env. We found that the FP peptide adopts a predominantly helical structure in membrane-mimetic environments, while the HR1 peptide is mostly unstructured in aqueous solution. We also identified the residues involved in the binding of the FP peptide to the HR1 peptide, and showed that this interaction is mediated by hydrophobic and electrostatic forces.

However, the factors that shape the composition and function of the gut microbiota are not fully understood. Diet is one of the main determinants of gut microbiota variation, but the effects of different dietary components on microbiota dynamics and host-microbe interactions are complex and context-dependent. In particular, the role of dietary fiber, a major component of plant-based foods, in modulating gut microbiota composition, diversity, and function is still controversial. : We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effects of dietary fiber interventions on gut microbiota outcomes in healthy adults. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases for relevant studies published up to March 31, 2020. We extracted data on study characteristics, fiber interventions, microbiota outcomes, and potential confounders. We assessed the risk of bias and the quality of evidence using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the GRADE approach, respectively. We performed random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the pooled effects of fiber interventions on alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, and relative abundances of major bacterial taxa. We also performed subgroup and sensitivity analyses to explore the sources of heterogeneity and the robustness of the results. Results/Conclusions: We included 43 RCTs with a total of 1,086 participants in the meta-analysis. We found that fiber interventions significantly increased the alpha-diversity (Shannon index) of the gut microbiota by 0.08 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.12, p = 0.001) compared with control interventions. Fiber interventions also significantly altered the beta-diversity (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) of the gut microbiota by 0.03 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.05, p = 0.007) compared with control interventions. Fiber interventions significantly increased the relative abundances of Bifidobacterium by 0.69% (95% CI 0.19% to 1.19%, p = 0.007), Lactobacillus by 0.36% (95% CI 0.10% to 0.62%, p = 0.007), and Faecalibacterium by 0.25% (95% CI 0.07% to 0.43%, p = 0.006) compared with control interventions. Fiber interventions did not significantly affect the relative abundances of other major bacterial taxa. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses showed that the effects of fiber interventions on gut microbiota outcomes were influenced by the type, dose, and duration of fiber, the baseline fiber intake, the control intervention, and the sequencing platform. The risk of bias was low or unclear for most of the included studies, but the quality of evidence was moderate or low for most of the outcomes. Our meta-analysis provides evidence that dietary fiber interventions can modulate the gut microbiota of healthy adults, increasing its diversity and enriching beneficial bacteria. However, the effects of fiber interventions are variable and depend on several factors that need to be considered in the design and interpretation of future studies.", "output": "\nSome possible titles based on the provided paragraph are:\n\n- Effects of dietary fiber interventions on gut microbiota composition, diversity, and function in healthy adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis\n- Dietary fiber interventions shape the gut microbiota of healthy adults: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials\n- How does dietary fiber modulate the gut microbiota of healthy adults?

Among various renewable energy sources, solar energy has the potential to provide abundant and clean power for human activities. However, the intermittency and variability of solar radiation pose challenges for the integration of solar power into the grid. Therefore, accurate and reliable solar forecasting methods are needed to facilitate the planning and operation of power systems. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid model that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for short-term solar irradiance forecasting. The proposed model can capture both the spatial and temporal features of solar irradiance data by using CNNs to extract spatial patterns from satellite images and LSTM networks to model temporal dependencies from numerical weather prediction data. The proposed model is evaluated on a real-world dataset of solar irradiance measurements from 20 stations in Australia. The results show that the proposed model outperforms several benchmark models, including persistence, artificial neural networks, support vector regression, and random forest. The proposed model also demonstrates robustness and generalization ability when applied to different locations and seasons. The proposed model can be used as a valuable tool for solar power forecasting and grid management.", "output": "\n\nSome possible titles based on the provided paragraph are:\n\n- A CNN-LSTM hybrid model for short-term solar irradiance forecasting using satellite and weather data\n- Short-term solar irradiance forecasting with a novel hybrid model of convolutional and recurrent neural networks\n- Spatial and temporal feature extraction for short-term solar forecasting using a hybrid CNN-LSTM model\n- A hybrid convolutional and long short-term memory network model for accurate and reliable short-term solar irradiance forecasting", "evaluation": 1}, {"input": "The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that infects and destroys CD4+ T cells, leading to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV has a high mutation rate and can evade the host immune system by generating viral variants. HIV also integrates its genome into the host cell DNA, forming a latent reservoir that is resistant to antiretroviral therapy (ART). The development of an effective HIV vaccine is hampered by the diversity and latency of the virus. Several strategies have been proposed to elicit potent and broad immune responses against HIV, such as using multiple antigens, adjuvants, and delivery systems. However, the optimal design and combination of these components remain unclear. In this review, we summarize the current status and challenges of HIV vaccine development, and discuss the potential of nanotechnology to improve the immunogenicity and efficacy of HIV vaccines. Nanoparticles can enhance the delivery and presentation of antigens, modulate the immune response, and target the mucosal tissues and the latent reservoir. We highlight the recent advances and future directions of using nanoparticles for HIV vaccine development.", "output": "\n\nSome possible titles based on the provided paragraph are:\n\n- Nanotechnology for HIV vaccine development: opportunities and challenges\n- Improving HIV vaccines with nanoparticles: a review of current progress and prospects\n- Nanoparticles as tools to enhance immune responses against HIV: state of the art and future perspectives\n- How nanotechnology can help overcome the diversity and latency of HIV: a review of novel strategies for vaccine design\n- Nanoparticle-based approaches for HIV vaccine development: a comprehensive overview", "evaluation": 1}, {"input": "The development of novel therapies for glioblastoma, the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor, is hampered by the lack of reliable preclinical models that recapitulate the molecular and cellular heterogeneity of the human disease.
