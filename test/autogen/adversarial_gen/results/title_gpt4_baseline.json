However, most of the current OER electrocatalysts suffer from low activity, poor stability, or high cost. Here we report a novel strategy to synthesize cobalt phosphide (CoP) nanowires embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) as a highly active and durable OER electrocatalyst. The CoP/N-CNTs composite exhibits a low overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm-2, a small Tafel slope of 49 mV dec-1, and a high mass activity of 17.8 A g-1 for the OER in 1 M KOH. Moreover, the CoP/N-CNTs composite shows excellent stability, retaining 95% of its initial current density after 50 h of continuous operation. The enhanced OER performance of the CoP/N-CNTs composite can be attributed to the synergistic effects of CoP nanowires and N-CNTs, which provide abundant active sites, fast charge transfer, and improved structural stability.

The composition and function of the gut microbiota are influenced by multiple factors, including diet, genetics, environment, and host immunity. Alterations in the gut microbiota, termed dysbiosis, have been associated with various diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, diabetes, and cancer. However, the causal relationships and underlying mechanisms of these associations are not fully understood. To elucidate the role of the gut microbiota in health and disease, various experimental approaches have been developed, such as fecal microbiota transplantation, germ-free animal models, and microbial engineering. These methods allow the manipulation of the gut microbiota and the investigation of its effects on host physiology, metabolism, and immunity. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the gut microbiota and its interactions with the host, and discuss the advantages and limitations of the experimental tools for studying the gut microbiota.

Diet is a major factor that influences the composition and function of the gut microbiota, but the responses to dietary changes vary widely across individuals. The sources of this variation are not fully explained by genetic or environmental factors, suggesting that other factors may modulate the gut microbiota's resilience or plasticity. Purpose: The aim of this review is to examine the evidence for the role of circadian rhythms in regulating the gut microbiota and the impact of chronodisruption on microbiota-associated health outcomes. Method: A literature search was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar databases, focusing on studies that investigated the interactions between circadian rhythms, diet, and the gut microbiota in humans and animal models. Results: The circadian system coordinates the temporal organization of physiological and behavioral processes, including feeding and sleeping patterns, immune system activity, and host-microbe interactions. The gut microbiota also exhibits diurnal fluctuations in composition and function, and can affect the circadian alignment of host tissues. Dietary interventions can alter the rhythmicity of the gut microbiota, and conversely, feeding time can modulate the effects of diet on the microbiota and host metabolism. Chronodisruption, induced by shift work, jet lag, or high-fat diets, can impair the coordination between the circadian system and the gut microbiota, leading to dysbiosis and increased susceptibility to inflammatory, metabolic, and mood disorders. Conclusions: Circadian rhythms are important regulators of the gut microbiota, and their disruption can compromise microbiota-host mutualism.

However, the interaction between the gut microbiota and the host circadian clock, which regulates physiological and behavioral rhythms in a 24-hour cycle, is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of chronic jet lag, a condition that disrupts the circadian rhythm, on the gut microbiota and host metabolism in mice. We found that chronic jet lag altered the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota, with a reduction in the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and an increase in the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. Moreover, chronic jet lag induced dysbiosis of the gut microbiota was associated with increased intestinal permeability, endotoxemia, inflammation, and metabolic disorders, including glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and obesity. These effects were reversed by fecal microbiota transplantation from control mice, indicating that the gut microbiota mediates the jet lag-induced metabolic dysfunction. Furthermore, we identified several potential key taxa and metabolites that were correlated with the jet lag-induced changes in the gut microbiota and host metabolism. Our findings reveal a novel link between the circadian clock and the gut microbiota, and suggest that manipulation of the gut microbiota may be a potential strategy to prevent or treat jet lag-associated metabolic disorders.

In this study, we investigated the effects of dietary fiber and antibiotics on the gut microbiota and immune system of mice. Methods: We fed mice with either a high-fiber or a low-fiber diet for four weeks, and treated them with either broad-spectrum antibiotics or saline for the last seven days. We analyzed the gut microbiota composition, diversity, and metabolic profile by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We also measured the levels of serum immunoglobulins, cytokines, and fecal short-chain fatty acids. Results: We found that both fiber and antibiotics had significant impacts on the gut microbiota, but in opposite directions. Fiber increased the abundance and diversity of beneficial bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, and enhanced the production of acetate and butyrate. Antibiotics reduced the abundance and diversity of the gut microbiota, and altered its metabolic profile, leading to lower levels of acetate, butyrate, and propionate. Fiber and antibiotics also affected the immune system in different ways. Fiber increased the levels of serum IgA and IgG, and the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10 and TGF-beta. Antibiotics decreased the levels of serum IgA and IgG, and increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha.

Moreover, the Co-NS/N-CNTs composite shows excellent stability, retaining 95% of the initial current density after 50 h of continuous operation. The superior OER performance of the Co-NS/N-CNTs composite can be attributed to the synergistic effects of the Co-NS and N-CNTs, which provide abundant active sites, efficient charge transfer, and improved structural stability. This work demonstrates a promising strategy to design and fabricate high-performance OER electrocatalysts based on metal-based nanosheets and carbon nanotubes.

Alterations in the gut microbial composition and function have been associated with various chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease. However, the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota influences host metabolism and immunity are not fully understood. One potential mediator is short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are produced by the fermentation of dietary fibers by the gut microbiota. SCFAs have been shown to modulate host energy metabolism, inflammation, and immune regulation. However, the effects of SCFAs on host gene expression and epigenetic modifications are less clear. Methods: In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the roles of SCFAs in regulating host gene expression and epigenetics, focusing on their effects on histone acetylation, DNA methylation, and microRNA expression. We also discuss the potential implications of SCFA-mediated epigenetic regulation for the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases. Results: SCFAs can influence host gene expression and epigenetics by acting as histone deacetylase inhibitors, modulating the activity and expression of DNA methyltransferases and demethylases, and affecting the biogenesis and function of microRNAs. These epigenetic changes can affect the expression of genes involved in various metabolic and immune pathways, such as glucose and lipid metabolism, inflammation, and immune cell differentiation. SCFA-mediated epigenetic regulation may contribute to the beneficial effects of dietary fibers and the gut microbiota on host health and disease. Conclusion: SCFAs are important mediators of the crosstalk between the gut microbiota and the host.

Dysbiosis of the microbiota, or an imbalance in its structure and function, has been associated with various chronic inflammatory and metabolic disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. However, the mechanisms by which the microbiota modulates host physiology and pathology are not fully understood. One of the emerging areas of research is the interaction between the microbiota and the endocannabinoid system (ECS), a network of lipid mediators and receptors that regulates various aspects of homeostasis, such as appetite, energy metabolism, immune response, pain, and stress. The ECS is present in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, as well as in various peripheral organs and tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract. The ECS can be modulated by the microbiota through several pathways, such as the production of endocannabinoid-like compounds, the alteration of endocannabinoid metabolism and transport, and the regulation of endocannabinoid receptor expression and signaling. Moreover, the ECS can also affect the microbiota composition and function, creating a bidirectional crosstalk that may have implications for host health and disease.

One potential way to modulate the gut microbiota is by using prebiotics, dietary compounds that selectively stimulate the growth and/or activity of beneficial microbes. However, the effects of prebiotics on the gut microbiota and host metabolism are highly variable and depend on several factors, such as the prebiotic type, dose, duration, and the baseline characteristics of the host. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effects of prebiotics on the gut microbiota composition and metabolic outcomes in healthy adults. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases for relevant studies published up to March 2020. We extracted data on study characteristics, prebiotic interventions, microbiota outcomes (abundance and diversity of specific bacterial groups), and metabolic outcomes (body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, glucose, insulin, lipid profile, and inflammatory markers). We assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane tool and the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. We performed random-effects meta-analyses and subgroup analyses to estimate the pooled effects of prebiotics and explore the sources of heterogeneity. Results: We included 42 RCTs with a total of 1,522 participants. Prebiotics significantly increased the abundance of bifidobacteria (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57 to 0.97) and lactobacilli (SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.43), but had no effect on the diversity of the gut microbiota.

We fed mice a low-fiber diet supplemented with either inulin, pectin, arabinoxylan, or resistant starch for four weeks and analyzed the changes in the microbiota composition, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, and host metabolic parameters. We found that each fiber type induced distinct and fiber-specific alterations in the gut microbiota, with inulin and pectin promoting the highest diversity and richness. All fibers increased the production of SCFAs, especially butyrate, which was positively correlated with the abundance of Bifidobacterium and Lachnospiraceae. Fiber supplementation also improved glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and plasma lipid profile in mice, with inulin and pectin showing the strongest effects.

In this review, we aim to synthesize the existing evidence on the effects of lockdowns on mental health outcomes, identify the risk and protective factors, and provide recommendations for future interventions and research. Methods: We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases for studies published from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 that reported on the mental health impacts of lockdowns due to COVID-19. We included studies that used quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods designs, and that assessed mental health outcomes using standardized instruments, clinical diagnoses, or qualitative analysis. We excluded studies that focused on specific clinical populations, such as patients with pre-existing psychiatric disorders, or that did not clearly differentiate the effects of lockdowns from other pandemic-related factors. We performed a narrative synthesis of the findings, grouped by the type of mental health outcome, the population subgroup, and the risk or protective factor. Results: We identified 148 studies that met our inclusion criteria, involving a total of 162,639 participants from 39 countries. The most commonly reported mental health outcomes were depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, stress, and psychological distress. The prevalence of these outcomes varied widely across studies, depending on the measurement tools, the time and duration of the lockdown, and the characteristics of the samples. The studies consistently found that lockdowns were associated with worse mental health outcomes than pre-pandemic levels or non-lockdown periods. The studies also identified several factors that moderated the effects of lockdowns on mental health, such as age, gender, education, income, employment, social support, coping strategies, and media exposure. Discussion: Lockdowns have had a detrimental impact on the mental health of the general population, as well as on specific subgroups that faced additional challenges during the pandemic. The evidence suggests that lockdowns should be used as a last resort measure, and that their duration and severity should be minimized as much as possible. Moreover, lockdowns should be accompanied by adequate mental health support and resources, tailored to the needs and preferences of different groups. Future research should address the methodological limitations of the existing studies, such as the lack of longitudinal and comparative designs, the use of convenience and non-representative samples, and the heterogeneity of the outcome measures.

However, the composition and function of the gut microbiota can be altered by various factors, such as diet, medication, and infection. One of the most common causes of gut microbiota dysbiosis is antibiotic treatment, which can have long-lasting effects on the diversity and stability of the microbial community. Objectives: To investigate the impact of antibiotic treatment on the gut microbiota of healthy adults, and to identify potential factors that influence the recovery of the microbiota after antibiotic cessation. Study design: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of 18 studies that used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to compare the gut microbiota of healthy adults before, during, and after antibiotic treatment. We extracted data on the antibiotic type, dose, duration, and indication, as well as the microbiota alpha and beta diversity, and the relative abundance of major bacterial taxa. We performed random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the pooled effect sizes of antibiotic treatment on the microbiota parameters, and meta-regression to explore the sources of heterogeneity. Results: Antibiotic treatment significantly reduced the alpha diversity and altered the beta diversity of the gut microbiota, with the largest effects observed during the treatment period. The alpha diversity partially recovered after antibiotic cessation, but remained significantly lower than the baseline level up to 6 months after treatment. The beta diversity also showed a trend of recovery, but the microbiota composition remained distinct from the baseline up to 12 months after treatment. The relative abundance of several bacterial taxa, especially Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, was significantly affected by antibiotic treatment, with variable patterns of recovery.

Among the various measures adopted to contain the spread of the virus, lockdowns have been widely implemented, with varying degrees of severity and duration. However, the impact of lockdowns on the mental health and well-being of the general population is still unclear. This systematic review aims to synthesize the evidence from studies that assessed the psychological effects of lockdowns on adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science for peer-reviewed articles published from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 that reported on the mental health outcomes of lockdowns in adults. We included studies that used any type of design, measurement, and comparison group, as long as they focused on lockdowns as the main exposure of interest. We excluded studies that targeted specific populations, such as health care workers, patients, or students. We assessed the quality of the included studies using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool and conducted a narrative synthesis of the findings. Results: We identified 55 studies that met our inclusion criteria, involving a total of 288,830 participants from 19 countries. The studies used various methods and instruments to measure mental health outcomes, such as depression, anxiety, stress, post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia, and suicidal ideation. The majority of the studies reported negative psychological effects of lockdowns, such as increased symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as reduced well-being and quality of life. Some factors that were associated with worse mental health outcomes were female gender, younger age, low income, low education, unemployment, living alone, having children, and having pre-existing physical or mental health conditions.

Livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) is a type of AMR bacteria that can be transmitted from animals to humans through direct contact or via the food chain or the environment. The prevalence and dynamics of LA-MRSA in pig farms and pig farmers are poorly understood in many countries, including China, which is the largest pig producer in the world. Methods: We conducted a longitudinal study to investigate the prevalence, persistence, and molecular characteristics of LA-MRSA in 20 pig farms and 10 pig farmers in Sichuan province, China. Nasal swabs were collected from pigs and farmers at three time points over a period of 6 months and screened for MRSA. MRSA isolates were characterized by spa typing, multilocus sequence typing, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Results: The overall prevalence of LA-MRSA in pigs was 24.5% (147/600), and the prevalence increased significantly from the nursery (10.0%) to the fattening (30.7%) stage. Sixteen out of 20 pig farms (80.0%) had at least one LA-MRSA positive pig, and 11 farms (55.0%) remained positive throughout the study period. The overall prevalence of LA-MRSA in pig farmers was 8.0% (8/100), and four farmers (40.0%) were persistent carriers of LA-MRSA. All LA-MRSA isolates belonged to clonal complex 9 (CC9) and t899 was the most common spa type (92.6%). LA-MRSA isolates showed high resistance rates to tetracycline (99.3%), erythromycin (89.3%), and clindamycin (87.3%), and low resistance rates to gentamicin (3.3%), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (2.0%), and ciprofloxacin (1.3%). No resistance to vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, or daptomycin was detected. Conclusion: Our study revealed a high and increasing prevalence of LA-MRSA CC9 in pigs and a low but persistent prevalence of LA-MRSA CC9 in pig farmers in Sichuan province, China.

One potential way to modulate the gut microbiota is through dietary interventions, such as prebiotics and probiotics. However, the effects of these interventions on the gut microbiota composition and function are highly variable and depend on several factors, such as the baseline microbiota, host genetics, and environmental factors. Objectives: To review the current evidence on the effects of prebiotics and probiotics on the gut microbiota and its implications for human health. Study Design: We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the effects of prebiotics and probiotics on the gut microbiota composition and function in healthy adults. We extracted data on the intervention type, dose, duration, outcome measures, and main findings. We also assessed the quality of the studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Results: We included 42 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. The majority of the studies used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to analyze the gut microbiota composition, while only a few studies measured the gut microbiota function using metagenomics, metabolomics, or other methods. The effects of prebiotics and probiotics on the gut microbiota were heterogeneous and depended on the intervention type, dose, duration, and baseline microbiota. Prebiotics generally increased the abundance of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, while probiotics had more strain-specific effects. The effects of prebiotics and probiotics on the gut microbiota function were less consistent and often not correlated with the changes in the composition.

Results: In this study, we propose a novel method based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in saliva samples using a microfluidic immunoassay. The microfluidic device consists of a paper-based strip embedded with a nitrocellulose membrane that contains two test lines: one coated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the other with human IgG. The saliva sample is mixed with a buffer containing gold nanoparticles conjugated with anti-human IgM and IgG, and then loaded into the device. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in the saliva sample results in the formation of a visible red line on the test line within 15 minutes. The intensity of the test line is proportional to the antibody level in the sample and can be quantified by a smartphone app. The device also has a control line that indicates the proper functioning of the assay.

The etiology of ASD is complex and heterogeneous, involving both genetic and environmental factors. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, may mediate the interaction between genes and environment, and influence the expression of ASD-related genes. Previous studies have identified altered DNA methylation patterns in ASD, but most of them focused on blood or saliva samples, which may not reflect the epigenetic changes in the brain. Objective: To investigate the genome-wide DNA methylation profile in the postmortem brain tissue of ASD cases and controls, and to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with ASD. Methods: We performed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) on 48 samples from the frontal cortex of 24 ASD cases and 24 controls, matched by age, sex, and ethnicity. We used a bioinformatic pipeline to process the sequencing data, align the reads to the reference genome, and identify the methylation level at each CpG site. We then performed differential methylation analysis to detect DMRs between ASD and control groups, using a sliding window approach and adjusting for multiple testing. We also annotated the DMRs to the nearest genes and performed gene ontology analysis to explore the biological functions of the DMR-associated genes. Results: We obtained an average of 16.8 million reads per sample, with an average mapping rate of 86.7%. We covered an average of 1.2 million CpG sites per sample, representing 5.6% of the total CpG sites in the human genome. We identified 1,632 DMRs between ASD and control groups, with 764 hypermethylated and 868 hypomethylated in ASD. The DMRs were enriched in gene promoters, especially in CpG islands. The DMR-associated genes were involved in several biological processes related to neuronal development, synaptic transmission, and immune response.

The enhanced OER performance of the TMO/CNT hybrids was attributed to the synergistic effects of CNTs, such as improved electrical conductivity, increased surface area, and favorable charge transfer. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the OER activity and stability of the TMO/CNT hybrids could be tuned by varying the TMO composition and CNT content.

We measured the levels of binding and neutralizing antibodies, as well as the frequency and functionality of spike-specific T cells, at baseline and up to six months after the second dose.

One of the emerging functions of the gut microbiota is the regulation of host circadian rhythms, which are endogenous biological cycles that orchestrate various physiological processes and behaviors. The circadian system consists of a central pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and peripheral oscillators in various tissues and organs, which are synchronized by environmental cues such as light and food. The gut microbiota can influence the circadian system through various pathways, including the production of metabolites, the modulation of immune system, and the communication with the enteric nervous system. In turn, the circadian system can also affect the composition and function of the gut microbiota by regulating host metabolism, immunity, and gut motility. The bidirectional interaction between the gut microbiota and the circadian system has important implications for host health and disease, as disruption of either component can lead to metabolic and inflammatory disorders.

In this study, we developed a novel biosensor platform based on graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Methods: We functionalized GFETs with single-stranded DNA probes that are complementary to a specific region of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The hybridization of the target RNA with the probes induces a change in the electrical properties of the GFETs, which can be measured as a shift in the Dirac point voltage. We optimized the performance of the biosensor by varying the probe length, concentration and hybridization time. Results: The GFET biosensor showed high sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with a detection limit of 10 pM and no cross-reactivity with other viral RNAs. The biosensor also demonstrated rapid detection, with a response time of less than 10 minutes.

Env is composed of a surface subunit (gp120) and a transmembrane subunit (gp41) that mediates viral entry by fusing the viral and cellular membranes. The metastable Env trimer undergoes conformational changes upon binding to the receptor (CD4) and the coreceptor (CCR5 or CXCR4) that result in the exposure of the gp41 fusion peptide (FP) and its insertion into the target membrane. The FP is followed by two heptad repeat regions, HR1 and HR2, that form a six-helical bundle structure that brings the viral and cellular membranes together. The HR1 and HR2 regions are initially separated in the native Env trimer and become associated during the fusion process. Peptides derived from the HR2 region, such as T20 (enfuvirtide), can bind to the HR1 region and inhibit the formation of the six-helical bundle, thus blocking viral entry. However, the emergence of T20-resistant HIV-1 strains limits the efficacy of this peptide. Here, we report the design and characterization of a novel peptide, named sifuvirtide, that is derived from the HR2 region but has a longer sequence and higher helical propensity than T20. We show that sifuvirtide has a higher affinity and specificity for the HIV-1 Env trimer than T20, and can potently inhibit a broad range of HIV-1 isolates, including T20-resistant strains, in vitro. We also demonstrate that sifuvirtide can prevent viral transmission and suppress viral replication in humanized mice.

The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AD are not fully understood, but growing evidence suggests that neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the initiation and progression of the disease. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, are activated in response to A\u03b2 accumulation and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which may further exacerbate the neurodegeneration. However, microglia also have neuroprotective functions, such as phagocytosis of A\u03b2 and debris, and secretion of anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic factors. Therefore, modulating microglial activation and polarization may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for AD. Methods: In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the role of microglia in AD, focusing on the molecular and cellular mechanisms of microglial activation, polarization, and phagocytosis. We also discuss the potential of targeting microglia for AD treatment, highlighting some natural and synthetic compounds that have shown anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo models of AD. Results: Several studies have demonstrated that microglia can adopt different phenotypes and functional states depending on the microenvironmental cues and stimuli. In AD, microglia may exhibit a detrimental pro-inflammatory phenotype (M1) or a beneficial anti-inflammatory phenotype (M2), or a mixed phenotype with both M1 and M2 features. The balance between these phenotypes may influence the outcome of the disease, as M1 microglia may aggravate the neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, while M2 microglia may promote the clearance of A\u03b2 and the resolution of inflammation. Moreover, microglia have the ability to phagocytose and degrade A\u03b2, which is essential for the maintenance of brain homeostasis and the prevention of plaque formation. However, in AD, microglial phagocytosis is impaired by several factors, such as aging, genetic mutations, and chronic inflammation. Therefore, enhancing microglial phagocytosis may be beneficial for the removal of A\u03b2 and the restoration of synaptic function. Conclusion: Microglia are key players in the pathophysiology of AD, and modulating their activation and polarization may offer novel therapeutic opportunities for the disease.

However, these models often require a large amount of annotated data, which is costly and time-consuming to obtain. Moreover, the performance of these models may degrade when applied to new domains or datasets that differ from the training data. Therefore, there is a need for methods that can leverage existing data and models to adapt to new scenarios with minimal human intervention. Methods: We propose a novel framework for semi-supervised domain adaptation of deep learning models for medical image analysis, based on the idea of self-training with pseudo-labels. The framework consists of three main components: a teacher model, a student model, and a domain adaptation module. The teacher model is a pre-trained model that can generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data from the target domain. The student model is a model that learns from both the labeled data from the source domain and the pseudo-labeled data from the target domain. The domain adaptation module is a component that aligns the feature distributions of the source and target domains, such as adversarial learning, cycle-consistency, or self-ensembling. We evaluate our framework on two tasks: chest X-ray image classification and brain tumor segmentation, using different datasets and domain adaptation modules. Results: Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on both tasks, outperforming existing methods for semi-supervised domain adaptation. We also show that our framework is robust to different choices of teacher models, student models, and domain adaptation modules.

However, the implementation of IPC measures may vary depending on the availability of resources, the level of preparedness, and the local context. Objective: This study aimed to assess the IPC practices and challenges in hospitals treating COVID-19 patients in different countries and regions. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of health workers who worked in hospitals that admitted COVID-19 patients between March and June 2020. The survey was administered online using a self-administered questionnaire that covered the following domains: IPC policies and guidelines, IPC training and supervision, availability and use of personal protective equipment (PPE), environmental cleaning and disinfection, waste management, and IPC challenges and needs. We used descriptive statistics to summarize the responses and compared the results by country and region. Results: A total of 1,234 health workers from 62 countries and 6 regions participated in the survey. The majority of the respondents were nurses (54.1%), followed by physicians (24.6%) and other health professionals (21.3%). The respondents reported varying degrees of IPC implementation in their hospitals, with some gaps and challenges identified in all regions. The main challenges reported were the shortage and inadequate quality of PPE (71.2%), the lack of IPC training and supervision (42.3%), the insufficient environmental cleaning and disinfection (34.5%), and the poor waste management (23.4%). The respondents also expressed the need for more IPC guidance and support, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

Dietary interventions have been shown to induce rapid and profound changes in the gut microbiota, which may have beneficial or detrimental effects on host metabolism and immunity. However, the dynamics and variability of these changes across individuals and populations are not well characterized. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effects of different dietary interventions on the gut microbiota in healthy adults. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases for relevant studies published up to March 2020. We extracted data on study characteristics, dietary interventions, microbiota outcomes, and potential moderators. We used random-effects models to estimate the pooled effect sizes and heterogeneity of dietary interventions on alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, and relative abundance of major bacterial phyla and genera. We also performed subgroup and meta-regression analyses to explore the sources of heterogeneity and the influence of moderators. Results: We included 71 RCTs with a total of 3979 participants in our meta-analysis. We found that dietary interventions had significant effects on alpha-diversity (Hedges' g = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.39, p < 0.001), beta-diversity (Hedges' g = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.41, p < 0.001), and relative abundance of several bacterial phyla and genera.

Env is composed of a surface subunit (gp120) and a transmembrane subunit (gp41) that mediate viral entry by binding to the CD4 receptor and a coreceptor, usually CCR5 or CXCR4, on the host cell. Env undergoes conformational changes upon receptor binding, leading to the exposure of the gp41 fusion peptide and the formation of a six-helix bundle that drives membrane fusion. Env is highly variable and shielded by a dense layer of N-linked glycans, which pose major challenges for the elicitation and recognition of broadly neutralizing antibodies.

Among the variants of concern, the B.1.1.7 lineage, first detected in the United Kingdom, has rapidly spread to many countries and regions. There is an urgent need to develop sensitive and specific assays for the detection and surveillance of this variant. In this study, we designed and evaluated a multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay that targets the spike gene mutations N501Y and 69-70del, which are characteristic of the B.1.1.7 lineage. The assay can simultaneously detect and differentiate the B.1.1.7 variant from other SARS-CoV-2 strains, as well as identify co-infections with multiple variants. The assay showed high analytical sensitivity and specificity, and no cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses. We applied the assay to 200 clinical samples from COVID-19 patients and confirmed the presence of the B.1.1.7 variant in 12 samples, with 100% concordance with whole genome sequencing results. The assay also detected two samples with co-infection of the B.1.1.7 variant and another variant with the E484K mutation. Our multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay is a useful tool for the rapid and accurate identification of the B.1.1.7 variant and its co-infections, which can facilitate timely public health interventions and epidemiological investigations.

Methods: We conducted a post hoc analysis of the RE-LY trial, a randomized, open-label, non-inferiority trial that enrolled 18,113 patients with NVAF and at least one risk factor for stroke. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either dabigatran 110 mg or 150 mg twice daily or warfarin dose-adjusted to an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0. The primary outcome was stroke or systemic embolism. The secondary outcomes included ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, death, and major bleeding. Results: A total of 3,623 patients (20%) had a history of stroke or TIA at baseline. These patients had higher rates of the primary outcome than those without prior stroke or TIA (2.87% vs 1.33% per year; hazard ratio [HR] 2.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.86-2.60, p < 0.001). Compared with warfarin, dabigatran 150 mg reduced the primary outcome in patients with prior stroke or TIA (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.58-1.02, p = 0.07) and in those without (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.51-0.81, p < 0.001), with a similar relative risk reduction (23% vs 36%, p for interaction = 0.36).

Here, we review the evidence for the role of the vagus nerve in mediating the effects of the gut microbiota on host physiology and behavior, focusing on animal and human studies that have investigated the impact of microbiota manipulation, vagus nerve stimulation, or vagotomy on various outcomes. We also discuss the possible mechanisms by which the gut microbiota and the vagus nerve interact, such as the production of microbial metabolites, the activation of gut hormones and immune cells, and the modulation of the enteric nervous system.

However, the potential toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials have raised serious concerns about their safety and biocompatibility. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the biological effects and interactions of nanomaterials with living systems. Among the various biological systems, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a critical interface that regulates the exchange of substances between the blood and the central nervous system (CNS). The BBB is composed of specialized endothelial cells, astrocytes, pericytes, and neurons, and it protects the CNS from harmful substances and maintains its homeostasis. However, the BBB also limits the delivery of therapeutic agents to the CNS, posing a major challenge for the treatment of neurological disorders. Nanomaterials have been explored as promising tools to modulate or overcome the BBB, either by enhancing their permeability across the BBB or by targeting specific receptors or transporters on the BBB. However, the interaction of nanomaterials with the BBB may also induce adverse effects, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and disruption of the tight junctions. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms and consequences of the nanomaterial-BBB interaction, as well as to develop reliable and relevant models to assess the BBB permeability and toxicity of nanomaterials. In this review, we summarize the recent advances and challenges in the field of nanomaterial-BBB interaction, focusing on the following aspects: (1) the structure and function of the BBB and its role in CNS diseases; (2) the strategies and mechanisms of nanomaterial-mediated modulation of the BBB; (3) the methods and models for evaluating the BBB permeability and toxicity of nanomaterials; and (4) the future perspectives and directions for the development of safe and effective nanomaterials for BBB modulation and CNS delivery.", "output": "- Nanomaterials for CNS delivery: how to modulate and assess the blood-brain barrier", "evaluation": 1}, {"input": "The human gut microbiota is a complex and dynamic community of microorganisms that plays a vital role in health and disease.

The WD increased the relative abundance of Bacteroides and Bilophila, genera associated with animal protein and fat digestion, and decreased the relative abundance of Prevotella and Roseburia, genera involved in the fermentation of dietary fiber. The WD also increased the fecal levels of bile acids, branched-chain amino acids, and phenolic compounds, and decreased the levels of short-chain fatty acids and indole derivatives.

HIV-1 infects and destroys CD4+ T cells, the main orchestrators of the adaptive immune response, leading to progressive immunosuppression and opportunistic infections. The viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) is the sole target of neutralizing antibodies and a major focus of vaccine development. Env is a trimeric complex composed of three gp120 and three gp41 subunits that mediates viral entry into host cells. Env undergoes conformational changes upon binding to the primary receptor CD4 and the coreceptor CCR5 or CXCR4, resulting in the exposure of the gp41 fusion peptide and the subsequent fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The Env trimer is highly variable, glycosylated, and shielded by non-neutralizing epitopes, making it a challenging target for antibody recognition. Several broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) have been isolated from HIV-1-infected individuals, which can neutralize diverse viral strains and prevent infection in animal models. These bNAbs target conserved regions of Env, such as the CD4 binding site, the coreceptor binding site, the membrane-proximal external region, and the glycan-dependent epitopes. Structural and functional studies of bNAbs and their interactions with Env have revealed the molecular mechanisms of neutralization and the features of a protective antibody response. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the structure and function of HIV-1 Env, the development and characteristics of bNAbs, and the potential applications of bNAbs for HIV-1 prevention and therapy.", "output": "- Structure and function of HIV-1 envelope and its conserved epitopes targeted by broadly neutralizing antibodies", "evaluation": 1}, {"input": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different types of music on the cognitive performance and mood of older adults.
