To subtract 8624 from 4700, we need to borrow from the leftmost digit of 4700, which is 4. We can subtract 1 from 4 and add 10 to the next digit, which is 7, to get 37.

We can also use the commutative and associative properties of addition and subtraction to rearrange the terms in any order that is convenient for us. For example, we can group the terms that have the same sign together and add or subtract them first.

Finally, we need to perform any addition and subtraction, but we have to remember that the symbols '@' and '#' have been replaced with '+' and '-', respectively. So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n2836 - 4912 + 1764 + 9283 - 3721 + 6543 - 8456\n\nTo simplify this equation, we can group the terms that have the same sign and add or subtract them. For example, we can group the positive terms as:\n\n(2836 + 1764 + 9283 + 6543) = 20426\n\nAnd we can group the negative terms as:\n\n(-4912 - 3721 - 8456) = -17089\n\nThen, we can subtract the negative sum from the positive sum to get the final answer:\n\n20426 - (-17089) = 37515\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 37515", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "1234 @ 5678 # 9012 @ 3456 # 7890 @ 1234 # 5678 # 9012", "output": "\nTo solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction.

Next, we need to perform the addition and subtraction, which are represented by the symbols '@' and '#', respectively.

To add the terms, we can align them by their place values and add them column by column, starting from the rightmost digit. For example, to add 1234 and 5678, we can write:\n\n  1234\n+ 5678\n------\n  6912\n\nSimilarly, we can add 6912 and 3456 to get 10368, and then add 10368 and 1234 to get 11602.

For example, to subtract 9012 and 7890, we can write:\n\n  9012\n- 7890\n------\n  1122\n\nSimilarly, we can subtract 1122 and 5678 to get -4556, and then subtract -4556 and 9012 to get -13568. This is the result of the second parentheses. Now, we can subtract the results of the two parentheses to get the final answer.

For example:\n\n  1234\n  5678\n  8765\n+ 3456\n+ 6789\n-----\n 25922\n\nSimilarly, to subtract the terms, we can align them by their place values and subtract them column by column, starting from the rightmost digit. If the digit on the top is smaller than the digit on the bottom, we need to borrow one from the next column. For example:\n\n  4321\n  9876\n  6543\n  7654\n- 2345\n-----\n  9005\n\nNow, we have simplified the equation to:\n\n25922 # 9005\n\nTo subtract these two numbers, we can again align them by their place values and subtract them column by column, starting from the rightmost digit. For example:\n\n 25922\n- 9005\n-----\n 16917\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 16917.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 16917", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "-1234 @ 5678 # 9101 @ 1122 # 3344 @ 4455 # 6789", "output": "\nTo solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations and replace the new symbols with the original ones.

For example, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(1234 @ 5678 @ 3141 @ 9201) # (9101 # 1121 # 5161 # 7181 # 1222)\n\nNow, we can add the terms inside the parentheses and subtract the terms outside the parentheses. To do this, we can use the standard algorithm for adding and subtracting large numbers, which involves aligning the digits by place value, adding or subtracting the digits in each column, and carrying or borrowing as needed. For example, to add 1234 and 5678, we can write:\n\n  1234\n+ 5678\n------\n  6912\n\nSimilarly, we can add 6912 and 3141 to get 10053, and then add 10053 and 9201 to get 19254. This is the result of adding the terms inside the first parentheses. To subtract 9101 and 1121, we can write:\n\n  9101\n- 1121\n------\n  7980\n\nSimilarly, we can subtract 7980 and 5161 to get 2819, and then subtract 2819 and 7181 to get -4362. Then, we can subtract -4362 and 1222 to get -5584. This is the result of subtracting the terms outside the parentheses. Finally, we can subtract 19254 and -5584 to get the final answer. To do this, we can write:\n\n  19254\n- -5584\n------\n  24838\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 24838.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 24838", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "1738 @ 4629 # 2956 @ 7381 # 9274 # 1863 @ 5497 # 3810", "output": "1738 @ 4629 # 2956 @ 7381 # 9274 # 1863 @ 5497 # 3810\n= (1738 + 4629) - 2956 + 7381 - 9274 - 1863 + 5497 - 3810\n= 6367 - 2956 + 7381 - 9274 - 1863 + 5497 - 3810\n= 3411 + 7381 - 9274 - 1863 + 5497 - 3810\n= 10792 - 9274 - 1863 + 5497 - 3810\n= 1518 - 1863 + 5497 - 3810\n= -345 + 5497 - 3810\n= 5152 - 3810\n= 1342\nFINAL ANSWER: 1342", "evaluation": 1}, {"input": null, "output": null, "evaluation": -1}, {"input": "-1234 @ 5678 # 9012", "output": "\nTo solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations and replace the new symbols with the original ones.

Since there are no parentheses or exponents in this equation, we can start with the multiplication and division. However, there are also no multiplication or division symbols in this equation, so we can skip this step as well. Next, we need to perform the addition and subtraction, which are represented by the symbols '@' and '#', respectively. We can do this from left to right, or we can group the terms that have the same symbol together.

Finally, we need to perform any addition and subtraction, but we have to remember that the symbols '@' and '#' have been replaced with '+' and '-', respectively. So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n1276 + 8345 - 4921 + 6734 - 1890\n\nTo simplify this equation, we can start by adding or subtracting any pairs of numbers that are next to each other. For example, we can add 1276 and 8345 to get 9621, and then subtract 4921 from that to get 4700. Similarly, we can add 6734 and 1890 to get 8624, and then subtract that from 4700 to get -3924. So, the equation becomes:\n\n4700 - 8624\n\nNow, we only have one subtraction left, so we can perform that and get the final answer. To subtract 8624 from 4700, we need to borrow from the leftmost digit of 4700, which is 4. We can subtract 1 from 4 and add 10 to the next digit, which is 7, to get 37. Then, we can subtract 8 from 37 to get 29. Next, we can subtract 6 from 10 to get 4, and then subtract 2 from 9 to get 7. Finally, we can subtract 4 from 4 to get 0.
