It was easy to use and the instructions were clear. The yogurt came out thick and creamy, just how I like it. I also liked that I could control the ingredients and the sweetness. It was fun to experiment with different flavors and toppings., Review_2: This is a great yogurt maker for beginners. It has a simple design and a timer that beeps when the yogurt is done. You just need to heat up some milk, add some starter culture, and pour it into the jars. The machine does the rest. The yogurt is delicious and healthy, and you can make up to seven jars at a time., Review_3: I was disappointed with this product. It did not make yogurt, it made milk soup. I followed the directions exactly, but the yogurt did not set at all. It was still liquid after 10 hours. I wasted a lot of milk and culture.

I tried to adjust the time and the milk quality, but nothing worked. It is very frustrating and a waste of time. I wish I had bought a better quality yogurt maker., Review_6: This is a nice yogurt maker for the price. It is not very fancy, but it does the job. The yogurt is tasty and smooth, and you can make a lot of it at once. It is not very difficult to use, but you have to be careful with the measurements and the timing. If you mess up, the yogurt will not turn out well., Review_7: I regret buying this product. It is very noisy and it leaks water. The jars are too small and they are hard to clean. The lids do not fit well and they pop off. The yogurt is bland and watery, and it has a strange aftertaste. I tried to return it, but the seller did not respond. I do not recommend this product to anyone., Review_8: This is a wonderful yogurt maker. It is very quiet and it has a water bath that keeps the temperature even.

The author is very talented and knowledgeable. He shares his tips and tricks on how to capture the essence and personality of the animals. The book is full of stunning examples and exercises. The book is suitable for all levels of artists, from beginners to experts., Review_7: This book is okay, but not great. It is a bit outdated and simplistic. The author only covers a few animals and does not go into much depth. The instructions are easy to follow, but not very creative or original. The illustrations are decent, but not very impressive. The book is fine for a quick reference, but not for a serious study., Review_8: This book is a must-have for anyone who loves animals and art. The book is very comprehensive and detailed. The author covers everything from anatomy, movement, expression, and emotion. The instructions are very clear and easy to follow. The illustrations are gorgeous and realistic. The book is a great source of inspiration and learning.", "output": "\n\nA possible summary is:\n\nSummary: This book is a guide on how to draw realistic and expressive animals, covering various aspects such as anatomy, shading, fur, and emotion.
