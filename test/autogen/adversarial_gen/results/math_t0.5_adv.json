So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n9345 + 2876 - 6543 + 1298 - 8732 - 4921 + 3674 + 5468 - 7384 + 2845\n\nTo simplify this equation, we can group the terms that have the same sign and add or subtract them. For example, we can group the terms that have a '+' sign as:\n\n(9345 + 2876 + 1298 + 3674 + 5468 + 2845)\n\nAnd the terms that have a '-' sign as:\n\n(6543 + 8732 + 4921 + 7384)\n\nThen, we can add or subtract these groups as:\n\n(9345 + 2876 + 1298 + 3674 + 5468 + 2845) - (6543 + 8732 + 4921 + 7384)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator or do the arithmetic by hand to find the sum of each group. The sum of the first group is:\n\n9345 + 2876 + 1298 + 3674 + 5468 + 2845 = 27606\n\nAnd the sum of the second group is:\n\n6543 + 8732 + 4921 + 7384 = 27580\n\nFinally, we can subtract the second group from the first group to get the answer:\n\n27606 - 27580 = 26\n\nTherefore, the answer is 26.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 26", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "5432 @ 9876 @ 1234 # 8765 # 4321 @ 7654 # 6543 # 3210 @ 4567", "output": "\nTo solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction.

To do this, we can use the standard algorithm of aligning the digits by place value, starting from the rightmost digit, and subtracting or adding them accordingly. We also need to borrow or carry over digits when necessary. For example, to subtract 4926 from 8375, we can do the following:\n\n  8375\n- 4926\n------\n  3449\n\nWe can repeat this process for the rest of the subtractions and additions within the parentheses.

We can use the same algorithm as before, but we need to pay attention to the signs of the numbers. Since we are adding a negative number and a positive number, we need to find the difference between their absolute values and use the sign of the larger number. For example, to add -15716 and 21389, we can do the following:\n\n  21389\n+ -15716\n-------\n   5673\n\nWe can see that the absolute value of 21389 is larger than the absolute value of -15716, so we use the positive sign for the result.

Remember that '@' means '+' and '#' means '-'.

So, we have:\n\n-23671 + 16058 - 2109\n\nAgain, using a calculator or mental arithmetic, we can find the value of this expression as:\n\n-10722\n\nTherefore, the answer to the equation is -10722.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: -10722", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "7845 # 3729 @ 9561 # 1432 @ 4876 # 6298 # 2156 @ 8943 # 1789", "output": "\nTo solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction.

This gives us:\n\n49980 - 49975\n\nFinally, we can subtract the second group from the first group. This gives us:\n\n5\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 5", "evaluation": 1}, {"input": "10000 # 9999 @ 9998 # 9997 @ 9996 # 9995 @ 9994 # 9993 @ 9992 # 9991", "output": "\nTo solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction.

For example, we can group the positive terms as:\n\n(10234 + 7839 + 2678 + 6789 + 3456)\n\nAnd the negative terms as:\n\n(-4956 - 10987 - 4321 - 8765 - 2345)\n\nThen, we can add or subtract these groups as:\n\n(10234 + 7839 + 2678 + 6789 + 3456) - (-4956 - 10987 - 4321 - 8765 - 2345)\n\nTo perform this calculation, we can use the rule that subtracting a negative number is the same as adding a positive number. So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(10234 + 7839 + 2678 + 6789 + 3456) + (4956 + 10987 + 4321 + 8765 + 2345)\n\nNow, we can add all the terms together by adding the corresponding digits from right to left and carrying over any extra ones to the next column. For example, starting from the rightmost column, we have:\n\n6 + 5 = 11, so we write 1 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\n5 + 4 + 1 = 10, so we write 0 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\n6 + 8 + 1 = 15, so we write 5 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\n9 + 7 + 1 = 17, so we write 7 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\n8 + 2 + 1 = 11, so we write 1 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\n7 + 4 + 1 = 12, so we write 2 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\n0 + 1 + 1 = 2, so we write 2 and there is nothing to carry over.\n\nThe final answer is 221751.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 221751", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "10000 # 1234 @ 5678 # 4321 @ 8765 # 6543 @ 2109 # 9876 # 3456", "output": "\nTo solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction.

We can do this from left to right, or we can group the terms that have the same symbol together and simplify them first. Either way, we should get the same answer. For example, we can do:\n\n7843 @ 4629 # 9284 @ 1765 # 5432 @ 8391 # 2736 # 6859 @ 4910 # 1067\n= (7843 + 4629 + 1765 + 8391 + 4910) - (9284 + 5432 + 2736 + 6859 + 1067)\n= 27538 - 25378\n= 2160\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n7843 @ 4629 # 9284 @ 1765 # 5432 @ 8391 # 2736 # 6859 @ 4910 # 1067\n= 7843 + 4629 - 9284 + 1765 - 5432 + 8391 - 2736 - 6859 + 4910 - 1067\n= 12472 - 9284 - 15027 + 4910\n= -4539 - 6594\n= -11133\n\nBoth methods give the same answer, so we can choose either one. The final answer is:\n\nFINAL ANSWER: -11133", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "9876 # 4567 @ 2345 @ 6789 # 1234 # 8765 @ 4321 # 5432 # 1098", "output": "9876 # 4567 @ 2345 @ 6789 # 1234 # 8765 @ 4321 # 5432 # 1098\n= (9876 - 4567) + 2345 + 6789 - 1234 - 8765 + 4321 - 5432 - 1098\n= 5309 + 2345 + 6789 - 1234 - 8765 + 4321 - 5432 - 1098\n= 7654 + 6789 - 1234 - 8765 + 4321 - 5432 - 1098\n= 14443 - 1234 - 8765 + 4321 - 5432 - 1098\n= 13209 - 8765 + 4321 - 5432 - 1098\n= 4444 + 4321 - 5432 - 1098\n= 8765 - 5432 - 1098\n= 3333 - 1098\n= 2235\nFINAL ANSWER: 2235", "evaluation": 1}, {"input": "9876 # 4321 @ 5678 # 1234 @ 8765 # 6789 # 3456 @ 7890", "output": "9876 # 4321 @ 5678 # 1234 @ 8765 # 6789 # 3456 @ 7890\n= (9876 - 4321) + (5678 - 1234) + (8765 - 6789) - (3456 - 7890)\n= 5555 + 4444 + 1976 + 4434\n= 16409\nFINAL ANSWER: 16409", "evaluation": 1}, {"input": "4721 # 9365 # 2847 @ 6493 @ 7835 @ 1957 # 3674 # 5298 # 7146 @ 3928", "output": "4721 # 9365 # 2847 @ 6493 @ 7835 @ 1957 # 3674 # 5298 # 7146 @ 3928\n= (4721 - 9365 - 2847) + (6493 + 7835 + 1957) - (3674 + 5298 + 7146) + 3928\n= (-7491) + (16285) - (16118) + 3928\n= -7491 + 20113\n= 12622\nFINAL ANSWER: 12622", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "9876 # 1234 @ 4321 @ 8765 # 2345 # 7654 @ 3456 # 9876", "output": "9876 # 1234 @ 4321 @ 8765 # 2345 # 7654 @ 3456 # 9876\n= (9876 - 1234) + 4321 + 8765 - 2345 - 7654 + 3456 - 9876\n= 8642 + 4321 + 8765 - 2345 - 7654 + 3456 - 9876\n= 12963 + 8765 - 2345 - 7654 + 3456 - 9876\n= 21728 - 2345 - 7654 + 3456 - 9876\n= 19383 - 7654 + 3456 - 9876\n= 11729 + 3456 - 9876\n= 15185 - 9876\n= 5309\nFINAL ANSWER: 5309", "evaluation": 1}, {"input": "7832 # 4629 @ 9285 # 1736 @ 3674 @ 4910 # 8395 # 2846", "output": "7832 # 4629 @ 9285 # 1736 @ 3674 @ 4910 # 8395 # 2846\n= (7832 - 4629) + (9285 - 1736) + 3674 + 4910 - 8395 - 2846\n= 3203 + 7549 + 3674 + 4910 - 8395 - 2846\n= 10752 + 8584 - 11241\n= 19036 - 11241\n= 7795\nFINAL ANSWER: 7795", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "7845 @ 4679 @ 2936 # 6382 # 9271 # 4058 @ 7123 @ 1849 # 5690 # 3814", "output": "\nTo solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction.
