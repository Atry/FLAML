However, it might be a bit redundant to repeat the word \"believe\" twice, and it could be more specific to say \"come and save them\" instead of \"come for them\".\n- Sentence 3: This sentence preserves the general meaning somewhat, but not as well as the other two. It reduces the complexity of the words and sentence structure a lot, but at the cost of clarity and naturalness.

For example, \"learns and tells things about nature\" is more precise than \"finds out and shares things about nature\", and \"works in nature\" and \"helps nature\" are more specific than \"does work in nature\" and \"speaks up for nature\". However, the sentence still omits some of the details of the input sentence, such as the terms data gathering and analysis, research, field projects, advocacy, and education.\n- The third sentence is the most complex in terms of word choice and phrase length, but it also preserves the most of the specificity and accuracy of the input sentence.

It also uses the word \"bad\" which might be too vague or informal for the context. It also uses the phrase \"things did not go as they hoped\" which might not capture the idea of a clash with reality as well as the original.\n- The second sentence is also simple, but it uses the word \"fans\" which might also imply a less serious or committed group than \"followers of a UFO cult\". It also uses the word \"match\" which might not convey the same sense of contradiction or conflict as \"clashed\".\n- The third sentence is the simplest of the three, and it does not use any words that might weaken or distort the meaning of the original. It uses the word \"sad\" which might be more appropriate than \"bad\" for the context. It also uses the phrase \"things went wrong\" which might be more clear and direct than \"things did not go as they hoped\" or \"reality did not match them\".\n\nTherefore, based on these criteria, we might choose the third sentence as the best simplified version of the original sentence.
