We can write this as:\n\n7912 - 9101 + 1121 - 3141 - 5161 + 7181 - 9202\n\nThen, we can continue with the next operation, which is 7912 - 9101, which gives -1189. We can write this as:\n\n-1189 + 1121 - 3141 - 5161 + 7181 - 9202\n\nWe can repeat this process until we have no more symbols left. The final result is:\n\n-1189 + 1121 - 3141 - 5161 + 7181 - 9202\n= -68 - 3141 - 5161 + 7181 - 9202\n= -3209 - 5161 + 7181 - 9202\n= -8370 + 7181 - 9202\n= -1189 - 9202\n= -10391\n\nTherefore, the answer to the equation is -10391.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: -10391", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "9823 # 4376 # 1259 @ 6745 @ 2938 # 8471", "output": "\nTo solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction.

So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n4732 + 4956 - 1387 + 7629 - 9245 - 3671 - 2819\n\nTo simplify this equation, we can start by adding or subtracting any pairs of numbers that are next to each other and have the same sign. For example, we can add 4732 and 4956, which are both positive, and subtract 9245 and 3671, which are both negative. This gives us:\n\n9688 - 1387 + 7629 - 12916 - 2819\n\nNext, we can add or subtract any remaining pairs of numbers that are next to each other and have the same sign.

This gives us:\n\n17317 - 4206 - 12916\n\nFinally, we can add or subtract the last three numbers, which have different signs. To do this, we can use the rule that subtracting a negative number is the same as adding a positive number, and vice versa. For example, we can rewrite -4206 as +(-4206) and -12916 as +(-12916). This gives us:\n\n17317 + (-4206) + (-12916)\n\nNow, we can add these numbers by lining up their digits and adding or subtracting them from right to left, carrying or borrowing as needed. For example:\n\n  17317\n+(-4206)\n+(-12916)\n--------\n   1195\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1195.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 1195", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "9734 @ 4876 # 1235 @ 8765 # 6543 # 4321 @ 3456 # 7890 # 2109", "output": "\nTo solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction.

Next, we need to perform the addition and subtraction, which are represented by the symbols '@' and '#', respectively.

To do this, we can use the standard rules of arithmetic, such as adding or subtracting the digits in the same place value, and carrying or borrowing as needed. For example, to add 1276 and 9458, we can start from the rightmost digit and work our way to the left.

This is the result of the addition within the first parentheses. Next, we can perform the subtraction within the second parentheses. To do this, we can use the standard rules of arithmetic, such as subtracting the digits in the same place value, and borrowing as needed. For example, to subtract 8134 from 6382, we can start from the rightmost digit and work our way to the left.

Similarly, we can subtract 1750 from -3752 to get -5502. This is the result of the subtraction within the second parentheses. Finally, we can subtract the result of the second parentheses from the result of the first parentheses, which is the same as adding the opposite of the result of the second parentheses.

We get:\n\n(-19147) @ (16795)\n\nFinally, we need to add these two numbers, which gives us:\n\n-19147 + 16795 = -2352\n\nTherefore, the answer is -2352.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: -2352", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "1234 @ 8765 # 4321 @ 5678 # 8765 # 1234 @ 4321 # 5678 # 2345 @ 6789", "output": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction.

For example, we can group the terms that have a '+' sign and add them together, and then group the terms that have a '-' sign and subtract them from the sum. This gives us:\n\n(10000 + 9998 + 9996 + 9994 + 9992) - (9999 + 9997 + 9995 + 9993 + 9991)\n\nNext, we can add or subtract the numbers in each group. This gives us:\n\n49980 - 49975\n\nFinally, we can subtract the second group from the first group.

For example, we can group the positive terms as:\n\n(9283 + 4920 + 6472)\n\nAnd the negative terms as:\n\n(-7345 - 1829 - 3901)\n\nThen, we can add or subtract these groups as:\n\n(9283 + 4920 + 6472) - (-7345 - 1829 - 3901)\n\nTo add or subtract two groups of terms, we can add or subtract the corresponding terms in each group. For example, to add 9283 and -7345, we can subtract 7345 from 9283 and get 1938. Similarly, we can add or subtract the other terms and get:\n\n(1938 + 2495 + 6472) - (-5174)\n\nTo simplify this further, we can add or subtract the terms in each group and get:\n\n10905 - (-5174)\n\nTo subtract a negative number, we can add its opposite, which is a positive number. So, we can rewrite this as:\n\n10905 + 5174\n\nTo add these two numbers, we can align them by their place values and add them from right to left, carrying over any digits that are more than 9. For example, we can start with the ones place and add 5 and 4, which gives 9. Then, we can move to the tens place and add 0 and 7, which gives 7. Next, we can move to the hundreds place and add 9 and 1, which gives 10. Since this is more than 9, we have to carry over 1 to the next place value. Finally, we can move to the thousands place and add 1 and 10, which gives 11. So, the final answer is:\n\n16079\n\nTherefore, the answer to the equation is 16079.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 16079", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "9999 # 8888 # 7777 # 6666 @ 5555 @ 4444 @ 3333", "output": "9999 # 8888 # 7777 # 6666 @ 5555 @ 4444 @ 3333\n= (9999 - 8888) - 7777 - 6666 + 5555 + 4444 + 3333\n= 1111 - 7777 - 6666 + 5555 + 4444 + 3333\n= -6666 - 6666 + 5555 + 4444 + 3333\n= -13332 + 5555 + 4444 + 3333\n= -13332 + 13332\n= 0\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 0", "evaluation": 1}, {"input": "1234 @ 5678 # 9101 @ 1121 # 3141 # 5161 @ 7181", "output": "\nTo solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction.

We can do this by adding the opposite of each term after the first one. For example, 9999 # 1111 is equivalent to 9999 + (-1111). Similarly, we can rewrite the whole equation as:\n\n9999 + (-1111) + (-2222) + (-3333) + (-4444) + (-5555) + (-6666) + (-7777) + (-8888) + (-9999)\n\nNow, we can use the standard rules of addition to simplify the equation. We can start by adding the digits in the same place value, starting from the rightmost column. For example, in the ones place, we have:\n\n9 + (-1) + (-2) + (-3) + (-4) + (-5) + (-6) + (-7) + (-8) + (-9) = -36\n\nSince this is a negative number, we need to borrow 1 from the next column and write -6 in the ones place. We also need to add 10 to the next column to account for the borrowing. So, in the tens place, we have:\n\n9 + (-1) + (-2) + (-3) + (-4) + (-5) + (-6) + (-7) + (-8) + (-9) + 10 = -26\n\nAgain, this is a negative number, so we need to borrow 1 from the next column and write -6 in the tens place. We also need to add 10 to the next column. So, in the hundreds place, we have:\n\n9 + (-1) + (-2) + (-3) + (-4) + (-5) + (-6) + (-7) + (-8) + (-9) + 10 = -26\n\nWe repeat the same process until we reach the leftmost column. In the thousands place, we have:\n\n9 + (-1) + (-2) + (-3) + (-4) + (-5) + (-6) + (-7) + (-8) + (-9) + 10 = -26\n\nSince this is the last column, we do not need to borrow or add anything. We just write -26 in the thousands place.

For example:\n\n   1234\n + 5678\n + 3456\n + 8765\n ------\n 19133\n\nSimilarly, we can do the same for the negative terms:\n\n  -9012\n  -7890\n  -4321\n ------\n -21223\n\nThen, we can subtract the negative group from the positive group by changing the sign of the negative group and adding it to the positive group. For example:\n\n  19133\n +21223\n ------\n  40356\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 40356.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 40356", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "7345 @ 9286 # 1739 @ 4567 # 8456 @ 1098 # 6723 # 3821", "output": "\nTo solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction.

For example, we can group 1732 and 4925, which are both positive, and add them to get 6657. Similarly, we can group 6381, 2847, 9154, and 3721, which are all negative, and add them to get -22103. Then, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n6657 + 7696 - 22103\n\nNow, we can add or subtract the remaining terms from left to right. First, we add 6657 and 7696 to get 14353.

We can do this from left to right, or we can group the terms that have the same symbol together. For example, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(9734 @ 2468 @ 4876 @ 9021) # (1395 # 8321 # 6745)\n\nNow, we can perform the addition and subtraction within each group of parentheses. To do this, we need to replace the symbols '@' and '#' with their original meanings, '+' and '-', respectively. For example, we can calculate:\n\n9734 @ 2468 @ 4876 @ 9021 = 9734 + 2468 + 4876 + 9021 = 26099\n\n1395 # 8321 # 6745 = 1395 - 8321 - 6745 = -14671\n\nNext, we need to perform the subtraction between the two groups of parentheses. To do this, we need to replace the symbol '#' with its original meaning, '-', and calculate:\n\n(9734 @ 2468 @ 4876 @ 9021) # (1395 # 8321 # 6745) = 26099 - (-14671) = 26099 + 14671 = 40770\n\nTherefore, the answer to the equation is 40770.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 40770", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "10000 @ 9999 # 9998 @ 9997 # 9996 @ 9995 # 9994 @ 9993 # 9992", "output": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations and replace the new symbols with the original ones.
