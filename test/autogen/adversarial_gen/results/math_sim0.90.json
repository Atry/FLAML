For the first group, we have:\n\n9573 # 4219 # 3678 # 1496 # 2845 # 7329\n= 9573 - 4219 - 3678 - 1496 - 2845 - 7329\n= -10294\n\nFor the second group, we have:\n\n7834 @ 6247 @ 8921 @ 4678\n= 7834 + 6247 + 8921 + 4678\n= 27680\n\nFinally, we can combine the two groups by performing the addition operation, which is represented by the symbol '@'. We have:\n\n-10294 @ 27680\n= -10294 + 27680\n= 17386\n\nTherefore, the answer is 17386.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 17386", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "9764 @ 4289 # 8123 @ 6491 # 2736 @ 9821 # 4679 @ 7354 # 9281 # 3467", "output": "\nTo solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction.

Since there are no parentheses or exponents in this equation, we can start with the multiplication and division. However, there are also no multiplication or division symbols in this equation, so we can skip this step as well. Next, we need to perform the addition and subtraction, which are represented by the symbols '@' and '#', respectively. We can do this from left to right, or we can group the terms that have the same sign together and simplify them first. For example, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(5623 @ 7834 @ 9281 @ 3467 @ 7290) # (4679 # 9821 # 6384 # 1456)\n\nNow, we can add up the terms inside the parentheses and then subtract them. To do this, we can use the standard algorithm for adding and subtracting large numbers, which involves lining up the digits according to their place value, adding or subtracting them column by column, and carrying or borrowing as needed. For example, to add 5623 and 7834, we can write:\n\n  5623\n+ 7834\n------\n 13457\n\nWe can repeat this process for the other terms inside the parentheses, and we get:\n\n 13457\n+ 9281\n------\n 22738\n\n 22738\n+ 3467\n------\n 26205\n\n 26205\n+ 7290\n------\n 33495\n\nThis is the sum of the terms with the '@' symbol. Next, we need to subtract the terms with the '#' symbol. We can use the same algorithm, but we need to be careful with borrowing when the subtrahend is larger than the minuend. For example, to subtract 4679 from 33495, we can write:\n\n  33495\n-  4679\n------\n  28816\n\nWe can repeat this process for the other terms inside the parentheses, and we get:\n\n  28816\n-  9821\n------\n  18995\n\n  18995\n-  6384\n------\n  12611\n\n  12611\n-  1456\n------\n  11155\n\nThis is the difference of the terms with the '#' symbol.

If the top digit is smaller than the bottom digit, we need to borrow 1 from the next column. To borrow 1, we add 10 to the top digit and subtract 1 from the next column. For example, in the rightmost column, we have 6 - 9, which is negative. So we borrow 1 from the tens column and write 10 + 6 - 9 = 7:\n\n  -45(6+10)\n#  789\n    7\n\n- Repeat the same process for the next column. We have 5 - 8, which is also negative.

For example, we can group the positive terms as:\n\n(9456 + 3728 + 4875 + 6384 + 1957) = 25700\n\nAnd we can group the negative terms as:\n\n-(8364 + 5297 + 2746 + 7845 + 1632) = -25084\n\nThen, we can subtract the negative sum from the positive sum to get the final answer:\n\n25700 - 25084 = 616\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 616", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "7832 @ 4679 # 9281 # 3764 @ 6491 # 1845 @ 2736 # 5629 # 7134 @ 8956", "output": "7832 @ 4679 # 9281 # 3764 @ 6491 # 1845 @ 2736 # 5629 # 7134 @ 8956\n= (7832 + 4679) - 9281 - 3764 + 6491 - 1845 + 2736 - 5629 - 7134 + 8956\n= 12511 - 9281 - 3764 + 6491 - 1845 + 2736 - 5629 - 7134 + 8956\n= 3230 - 3764 + 6491 - 1845 + 2736 - 5629 - 7134 + 8956\n= -534 + 6491 - 1845 + 2736 - 5629 - 7134 + 8956\n= 5957 - 1845 + 2736 - 5629 - 7134 + 8956\n= 4112 + 2736 - 5629 - 7134 + 8956\n= 6848 - 5629 - 7134 + 8956\n= 1225 - 7134 + 8956\n= -5909 + 8956\n= 3047\nFINAL ANSWER: 3047", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "4729 @ 8365 # 2478 # 6893 @ 9536 # 1284 # 5796 @ 4278 # 3679 # 8945", "output": "4729 @ 8365 # 2478 # 6893 @ 9536 # 1284 # 5796 @ 4278 # 3679 # 8945\n= (4729 + 8365) - 2478 - 6893 + 9536 - 1284 - 5796 + 4278 - 3679 - 8945\n= 13094 - 2478 - 6893 + 9536 - 1284 - 5796 + 4278 - 3679 - 8945\n= 10616 - 6893 + 9536 - 1284 - 5796 + 4278 - 3679 - 8945\n= 3723 + 9536 - 1284 - 5796 + 4278 - 3679 - 8945\n= 13259 - 1284 - 5796 + 4278 - 3679 - 8945\n= 11975 - 5796 + 4278 - 3679 - 8945\n= 6179 + 4278 - 3679 - 8945\n= 10457 - 3679 - 8945\n= 6778 - 8945\n= -2167\nFINAL ANSWER: -2167", "evaluation": 1}, {"input": "9876 # 4321 @ 1234 @ 5678 # 8765 @ 4321 # 6543 @ 7890 # 2109", "output": "9876 # 4321 @ 1234 @ 5678 # 8765 @ 4321 # 6543 @ 7890 # 2109\n= (9876 - 4321) + 1234 + 5678 - 8765 + 4321 - 6543 + 7890 - 2109\n= 5555 + 1234 + 5678 - 8765 + 4321 - 6543 + 7890 - 2109\n= 6789 + 5678 - 8765 - 2222 + 7890 - 2109\n= 12467 - 8765 - 4331 - 2109\n= 3692 - 6439\n= -2747\nFINAL ANSWER: -2747", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "6214 @ 7839 @ 4672 # 9285 # 3764 @ 5391 # 8457 # 1936 @ 2874 @ 6493 # 4728", "output": "\nTo solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction.
