Next, we need to perform the addition and subtraction, which are represented by the symbols '@' and '#', respectively. We can do this from left to right, or we can group the terms that have the same symbol together. For example, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(9736 # 4289 # 1760 # 8945 # 3124) @ (7835 @ 6492)\n\nNow, we can simplify each group by performing the subtraction and addition operations.

To do this, we can use the standard algorithm for adding and subtracting large numbers, which involves lining up the digits according to their place values, adding or subtracting them column by column, and carrying or borrowing as needed. For example, to add 1234 and 5678, we can write:\n\n  1234\n+ 5678\n------\n  6912\n\nWe can repeat this process for the other terms inside the parentheses, and we get:\n\n  6912\n+ 9012\n------\n 15924\n\n 15924\n+ 7890\n------\n 23814\n\n 23814\n+ 6789\n------\n 30603\n\nThis is the sum of the terms with the '@' symbol. Next, we need to subtract the terms with the '#' symbol. We can use the same algorithm, but we need to be careful with borrowing when the subtrahend is larger than the minuend in a column. For example, to subtract 3456 and 123, we can write:\n\n  3456\n-  123\n------\n  3333\n\nWe can repeat this process for the other terms inside the parentheses, and we get:\n\n  3333\n- 4567\n------\n -1234\n\n -1234\n- 8901\n------\n-10135\n\n-10135\n- 2345\n------\n-12480\n\nThis is the difference of the terms with the '#' symbol. Finally, we need to subtract the two results we obtained from the parentheses, which are 30603 and -12480. We can use the same algorithm again, but we need to remember that subtracting a negative number is the same as adding its positive counterpart. For example, to subtract -12480 from 30603, we can write:\n\n  30603\n+ 12480\n------\n  43083\n\nThis is the final answer of the equation.

For example:\n\n  9876\n+ 4321\n+ 1234\n+ 6789\n------\n 22220\n\nSimilarly, to subtract the terms, we can align them by their place values and subtract them column by column, starting from the rightmost column. If the top digit is smaller than the bottom digit, we need to borrow one from the next column. For example:\n\n  8765\n- 5432\n- 2109\n------\n  1224\n\nFinally, we can subtract the two results to get the final answer. Again, we can align them by their place values and subtract them column by column, starting from the rightmost column. For example:\n\n 22220\n- 1224\n------\n 20996\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 20996.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 20996", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "7894 @ 4321 @ 9876 # 6543 # 1234 @ 5678 # 8765 # 4321 # 3456", "output": "7894 @ 4321 @ 9876 # 6543 # 1234 @ 5678 # 8765 # 4321 # 3456\n= (7894 + 4321 + 9876 - 6543 - 1234 + 5678 - 8765 - 4321 - 3456) // replace the symbols with the original operators\n= (12091 + 9876 - 7777 + 5678 - 16542) // perform the additions and subtractions within the parentheses\n= (21967 - 7777 - 16542) // perform the remaining additions\n= (-32352) // perform the remaining subtractions\nFINAL ANSWER: -32352", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "10000 # 1234 @ 5678 # 4321 @ 8765 # 6543 @ 3210 # 9876 # 1098 @ 7654", "output": "10000 # 1234 @ 5678 # 4321 @ 8765 # 6543 @ 3210 # 9876 # 1098 @ 7654\n= (10000 - 1234) + 5678 - 4321 + 8765 - 6543 + 3210 - 9876 - 1098 + 7654\n= 8766 + 5678 - 4321 + 8765 - 6543 + 3210 - 9876 - 1098 + 7654\n= 14444 - 4321 + 8765 - 6543 + 3210 - 9876 - 1098 + 7654\n= 10123 + 8765 - 6543 + 3210 - 9876 - 1098 + 7654\n= 18888 - 6543 + 3210 - 9876 - 1098 + 7654\n= 12345 + 3210 - 9876 - 1098 + 7654\n= 15555 - 9876 - 1098 + 7654\n= 5681 - 1098 + 7654\n= 4583 + 7654\n= 12237\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 12237", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "7835 # 4562 @ 9281 # 1739 @ 6472 @ 3810 # 8496 # 2647 @ 1904 # 722", "output": "7835 # 4562 @ 9281 # 1739 @ 6472 @ 3810 # 8496 # 2647 @ 1904 # 722\n= (7835 - 4562) + (9281 - 1739) + 6472 + 3810 - 8496 - 2647 + 1904 - 722\n= 3273 + 7542 + 6472 + 3810 - 8496 - 2647 + 1904 - 722\n= 10815 + 10282 - 11143 + 1182\n= 21097 - 11143 + 1182\n= 9960 + 1182\n= 11142\nFINAL ANSWER: 11142", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "9734 @ 4629 # 1845 @ 9281 # 3765 # 6392 # 8457", "output": "\nTo solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction.

Doing this, we get:\n\n19999 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 19991 - 1\n\nNow, we can simplify this further by adding or subtracting any pairs of numbers that have the same sign. For example, we can add 19999 and 1 to get 20000, or subtract 1 and 1 to get 0. We can also add 1 and 19991 to get 19992, or subtract 1 and 0 to get -1. Doing this, we get:\n\n20000 - 1 + 19992 - 1\n\nFinally, we can simplify this by adding or subtracting the remaining numbers. We can add 20000 and 19992 to get 39992, or subtract 1 and 1 to get 0. Doing this, we get:\n\n39992 - 0\n\nThis is the simplest form of the equation, and the answer is 39992.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 39992", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "7890 @ 4567 # 1234 @ 9012 # 3456 # 6789 @ 2345 # 8901", "output": "\nTo solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction.

Finally, we need to perform the addition and subtraction, which are represented by the symbols '@' and '#', respectively. We can do this from left to right, or we can group the terms that have the same sign and combine them first.

For example, we can group the terms that have a '+' sign and add them together, and then group the terms that have a '-' sign and subtract them from the sum. This gives us:\n\n(9999 + 9999 + 9999 + 9995) - (9998 + 9997 + 9996)\n\nNow, we can add or subtract the numbers in each group. To do this, we can align the digits by their place value and add or subtract them column by column, starting from the rightmost column. For example, to add 9999 and 9999, we can write:\n\n  9999\n+ 9999\n------\n 19998\n\nWe can do the same for the other numbers in each group, and then subtract the two groups. This gives us:\n\n 29992\n-29991\n------\n     1\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 1.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 1", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "1063 @ 9876 # 4321 @ 6543 # 8765 @ 2345 # 5432", "output": "\nTo solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction.

For the first group, we have:\n\n9274 # 1638 # 7593 # 4921 # 3678 = 9274 - 1638 - 7593 - 4921 - 3678 = -9556\n\nFor the second group, we have:\n\n4876 @ 2845 @ 6543 = 4876 + 2845 + 6543 = 14264\n\nFinally, we can combine the two groups by performing the addition operation, which is represented by the symbol '@'. We have:\n\n-9556 @ 14264 = -9556 + 14264 = 4708\n\nTherefore, the answer to the equation is 4708.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 4708", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "10000 # 1234 # 5678 @ 4321 @ 8765 # 5432 # 7654", "output": "\nTo solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction.
