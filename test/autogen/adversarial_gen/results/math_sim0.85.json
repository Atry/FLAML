For example, we can group the positive terms as:\n\n(7894 + 3726 + 4958 + 9642) = 26020\n\nAnd we can group the negative terms as:\n\n(-6213 - 8537 - 1738 - 4289 - 2674 - 1496) = -33947\n\nThen, we can subtract the negative sum from the positive sum to get the final answer:\n\n26020 - (-33947) = 59967\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 59967", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "9274 @ 5836 # 1457 @ 3679 # 8945 # 6123 @ 4918 # 7386 # 2794 @ 6543", "output": "\nTo solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction.

For example, we can group the positive terms as:\n\n(4356 + 9876 + 1234 + 6789) = 22255\n\nAnd we can group the negative terms as:\n\n(-7654 - 8765 - 4321 - 9876 - 5432 - 1098) = -35946\n\nThen, we can subtract the negative group from the positive group to get the final answer:\n\n22255 - (-35946) = 22255 + 35946 = 58201\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 58201.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 58201", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "9562 # 3471 @ 4839 # 1285 @ 7641 # 2938 @ 9285 # 6147 # 4056 @ 3789", "output": "\nTo solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction.

Since there are no parentheses or exponents in this equation, we can start with the multiplication and division. However, there are also no multiplication or division symbols in this equation, so we can skip this step as well. Next, we need to perform the addition and subtraction, which are represented by the symbols '@' and '#', respectively. We can do this from left to right, or we can group the terms that have the same sign and combine them first. For example, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(4912 # 7834 # 1467 # 6398 # 2731 # 4190) @ (3679 @ 9285 @ 8546 @ 1764)\n\nNow, we can simplify each group by adding or subtracting the numbers. For the group with the '#' symbol, we need to subtract the numbers, starting from the leftmost one. For the group with the '@' symbol, we need to add the numbers, starting from the leftmost one. We get:\n\n(-17708) @ (23274)\n\nFinally, we need to perform the last operation, which is '@', or addition. We add the two numbers and get:\n\n5536\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5536.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 5536", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "4356 @ 9876 @ 1234 # 7654 # 8765 # 4321 @ 6789 # 9876 # 5432 # 1098", "output": "\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction.

We add the two numbers and get:\n\n5536\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5536.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 5536", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "7845 # 3126 @ 9764 # 4832 @ 6291 # 8476 # 2954 @ 7138 # 4629", "output": "7845 # 3126 @ 9764 # 4832 @ 6291 # 8476 # 2954 @ 7138 # 4629\n= (7845 - 3126) + (9764 - 4832) + (6291 - 8476) - (2954 + 7138) - 4629\n= 4719 + 4932 - 2185 - 10092 - 4629\n= 9649 - 16906\n= -7257\nFINAL ANSWER: -7257", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "7845 # 3679 @ 9456 # 2819 # 6387 @ 1729 @ 4568 # 8943 # 1276 # 3598", "output": "\nTo solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction.

For example:\n\n(1234 + 5678 + 9012 + 2345 + 6789) - (3456 + 7890 + 1234 + 5678 + 9012)\n\n= 26058 - 30270\n\n= -4212\n\nTherefore, the final answer is -4212.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: -4212", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "6214 @ 7839 @ 4672 # 9285 # 3764 @ 5391 # 8457 # 1936 @ 2874 @ 6493 # 4728", "output": "\nTo solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction.

Finally, we need to perform any addition and subtraction, but we have to remember that the symbols '@' and '#' have been replaced with '+' and '-', respectively.

For example, we can group all the positive terms and add them together, and then group all the negative terms and add them together, and then subtract the second sum from the first sum. This gives us:\n\n(5623 + 9471 + 3896 + 7240 + 1839 + 6147 + 8360) - (4678 + 9285 + 3729)\n\nAdding the positive terms, we get:\n\n(5623 + 9471 + 3896 + 7240 + 1839 + 6147 + 8360) = 40576\n\nAdding the negative terms, we get:\n\n(4678 + 9285 + 3729) = 17692\n\nSubtracting the second sum from the first sum, we get:\n\n40576 - 17692 = 22884\n\nTherefore, the answer to the equation is 22884.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 22884", "evaluation": 0}, {"input": "9764 @ 4289 # 8123 @ 6491 # 2736 @ 9821 # 4679 @ 7354 # 9281 # 3467", "output": "\nTo solve this equation, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction.

Next, we need to perform the addition and subtraction, which are represented by the symbols '@' and '#', respectively.

For example, 4558 @ 7654 is the same as 4558 + 7654, which is 12212. Similarly, 12212 # 6543 is the same as 12212 - 6543, which is 5669. We can do this for all the terms in the equation and get:\n\n5669 # 3210 @ 1098\n\nThis expression can be further simplified by subtracting or adding the terms from left to right, following the order of the symbols. For example, 5669 # 3210 is the same as 5669 - 3210, which is 2459. Similarly, 2459 @ 1098 is the same as 2459 + 1098, which is 3557.
