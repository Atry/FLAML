However, the automated systems that\\nincreasingly mediate our interactions online -- such as chatbots, content\\nmoderation systems, and search engines -- are primarily designed for and work\\nfar more effectively in English than in the world's other 7,000 languages.\\nRecently, researchers and technology companies have attempted to extend the\\ncapabilities of large language models into languages other than English by\\nbuilding what are called multilingual language models.\\n  In this paper, we explain how these multilingual language models work and\\nexplore their capabilities and limits. Part I provides a simple technical\\nexplanation of how large language models work, why there is a gap in available\\ndata between English and other languages, and how multilingual language models\\nattempt to bridge that gap. Part II accounts for the challenges of doing\\ncontent analysis with large language models in general and multilingual\\nlanguage models in particular.

We demonstrate empirically that a large\\nEnglish language model coupled with modern machine translation outperforms\\nnative language models in most Scandinavian languages. The exception to this is\\nFinnish, which we assume is due to inferior translation quality. Our results\\nsuggest that machine translation is a mature technology, which raises a serious\\ncounter-argument for training native language models for low-resource\\nlanguages. This paper therefore strives to make a provocative but important\\npoint.

TReE contains three stages: observation,\\nthinking, and re-thinking. Observation stage indicates that VLM obtains the\\noverall information of the relative image.
