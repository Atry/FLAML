    "SYSTEM:  Human feedback: There are 190 people on the beach. 110 are wearing sunglasses, 70 are wearing bathing suits, and 95 are wearing a hat. Everyone is wearing at least one of these items. 30 are wearing both bathing suits and sunglasses. 25 are wearing both bathing suits and a hat. 40 are wearing both sunglasses and a hat. How many people are wearing all three items?\n",
    "MATHSOLVERGPT THOUGHTS:  This is a problem of set theory, specifically a problem of three intersecting sets. We can solve it using the principle of inclusion and exclusion. The principle of inclusion-exclusion states that for any three sets, the size of the union of the sets is the sum of the sizes of the sets individually, minus the size of each pair of intersecting sets, plus the size of the intersection of all three sets. We know the total number of people (190), the number of people in each individual set (110 for sunglasses, 70 for bathing suits, 95 for hats), and the number of people in each pair of intersecting sets (30 for bathing suits and sunglasses, 25 for bathing suits and hats, 40 for sunglasses and hats). We can use this information to solve for the number of people in the intersection of all three sets.\n",
