  "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
  "solution": "Each of the $x^2$-terms in the expansion of the product is obtained by multiplying the $x$-terms from two of the 15 factors of the product.  The coefficient of the $x^2$-term is therefore the sum of the products of each pair of numbers in the set $\\{-1,2,-3,\\ldots,14,-15\\}$. Note that, in general, $$(a_1+a_2+\\cdots+a_n)^2=a_1^2+a_2^2+\\cdots+a_n^2+2\\cdot\\left(\\sum_{1\\le\ni<j\\le n}a_ia_j\\right).$$Thus, the coefficient of $x^2$ is  \\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{1\\le i<j\\le15}(-1)^{i}i(-1)^{j}j&=\n\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left(\\sum^{15}_{k=1}(-1)^{k}k\\right)^2-\n\\sum^{15}_{k=1}k^2\\right)\\cr\n&=\\frac{1}{2}\\left((-8)^2-\\frac{15(15+1)(2\\cdot15+1)}{6}\\right)=-588.\\cr\n\\end{align*}$$\\centerline{\\bf {OR}}$$Let $C$ be the coefficient of $x^2.$  Then\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x)&=(1-x)(1+2x)(1-3x)\\dotsm(1-15x)\\cr\n&=1+(-1+2-3+\\cdots-15)x+Cx^2+\\cdots\\cr &=1-8x+Cx^2+\\cdots.\\cr\n\\end{align*}Thus $f(-x)=1+8x+Cx^2-\\cdots\\,$. But $f(-x)=(1+x)(1-2x)(1+3x)\\ldots(1+15x)$, so  \\begin{align*}\nf(x)f(-x)&=\n(1-x^2)(1-4x^2)(1-9x^2)\\dotsm(1-225x^2)\\cr&=\n1-(1^2+2^2+3^2+\\cdots+15^2)x^2+\\cdots.\n\\end{align*}Also $f(x)f(-x)=\n(1-8x+Cx^2+\\cdots)(1+8x+Cx^2-\\cdots)=1+(2C-64)x^2+\\cdots\\,$. Thus $2C-64=-(1^2+2^2+3^3+\\cdots+15^2)$, and, as above, $C=\\boxed{-588}$.",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\n\nProblem: Find the coefficient of $x^2$ in the expansion of the product $$(1-x)(1+2x)(1-3x)\\dotsm(1+14x)(1-15x).$$"

      "content": "To find the coefficient of $x^2$ in the expansion of the product, we can use the distributive property and consider the different ways to obtain a term of $x^2$ by multiplying one term from each expression in the product.\n\nLet's represent the $i$-th expression in the product as $(1 + a_ix)$ where $a_i$ will be either positive or negative for consecutive integers from 1 to 15. So $a_i = (-1)^{i+1}(i+1)$, for $i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, 14$.\n\nNow, to obtain an $x^2$ term, we need to choose exactly one term of degree 1 ($x$) from two of the expressions and a constant term (degree 0) from the remaining 13 expressions. This can be done in multiple ways, and we will sum the coefficients of the individual $x^2$ terms obtained in each way.\n\nThus, we can write the query required to find the coefficient of $x^2$ as:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import sum, (-1)**(i+1) * (i+1) for i in range(15)\n\ncoefficient_x2 = 0\nfor i in range(14):\n    for j in range(i+1, 15):\n        coefficient_x2 += (-1)**(i+1) * (i+1) * (-1)**(j+1) * (j+1)\n\nprint(coefficient_x2)\n```\nPlease run the above Python code to find the coefficient of $x^2$."
