You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct.

Then, the given expression can be written as $a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2$.\n\nBefore applying the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, we need to find the products $a_1^2 + a_2^2$ and $b_1^2 + b_2^2$."

The minimum value must occur when the equality doesn't hold in the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality. Let's analyze the denominator of the given expression to understand when the equality doesn't hold. \n\nIn the denominator, we have $(1 + x^2)(1 + y^2)$. If one of the terms $1+x^2$ or $1+y^2$ is very large, then the given expression approaches 0. So, we can take the minimum value of the given expression to be 0. Hence, the range of possible values of the expression will be between the maximum value and 0.\n\nNow let's find the maximum value of the given expression when the relation between $x$ and $y$ holds:\n\n\\[\\frac{(x + y)(1 - xy)}{(1 + x^2)(1 + y^2)}\\]\n\nReplacing $(1 - y)(x + 1)$ with $(x^2 + 1)$, we get:\n\n\\[\\frac{(x + y)(x^2 + 1)}{(1 + x^2)(1 + y^2)}\\]\n\nWe've already identified the minimum value as 0.

The numerator $x + y$ is maximized when one of $x$ or $y$ is large and positive, and the other one is small and negative (imagine one becoming very large while the other one is staying close to zero or going in the opposite direction). We also know that the denominator $1 + y^2$ is always positive.\n\nAs the numerator goes to infinity and the denominator stays positive, the above expression will also go to infinity. However, we must remember that we obtained this result by assuming the equality condition in the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality. This extreme case does not actually represent a situation allowed by the problem since x and y are bound by the relation we derived.\n\nTherefore, we must conclude that there is no maximum value for the expression because the extreme case that would give us the maximum value goes beyond the limits set by the relation. The set of possible values of the given expression is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{(-\\infty, 0]}\\]"
