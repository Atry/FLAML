  "solution": "There are \\[\n\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8!}{6!\\cdot 2!} = 28\n\\]ways to choose the bills. A sum of at least $\\$20$ is obtained by choosing  both $\\$20$ bills, one of the  $\\$20$ bills and one of the six smaller bills, or both $\\$10$ bills.

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\n\nProblem: An envelope contains eight bills: 2 ones, 2 fives, 2 tens, and 2 twenties.

We have 8 bills, so the total number of ways to pick 2 bills is the combination of 8 items taken 2 at a time (8 choose 2).\n\nNow, let's find out the number of ways to pick two bills that sum to $20 or more. We have the following possibilities:\n1. One bill of $10 and one bill of $20.\n2. Two bills of $20.\n\nWe'll calculate the number of ways to pick bills for each possibility and sum them up.\n\n1. The number of ways to pick one bill of $10 and one bill of $20:\nThere are 2 ways to pick a $10 bill and 2 ways to pick a $20 bill. So, the number of ways to pick one bill of $10 and one bill of $20 is 2 * 2.\n\n2. The number of ways to pick two bills of $20:\nThere are 2 ways to pick the first $20 bill, and 1 way to pick the second $20 bill. So, the number of ways to pick two bills of $20 is 2 choose 2.\n\nNow, let's calculate these values using Python."
