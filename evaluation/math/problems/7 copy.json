If a two-letter sequence of letters (such as CO or EE) is chosen at random, what is the probability that it is a postal abbreviation for one of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico?

  "solution": "There are $26\\cdot 26$ possible two-letter sequences of letters, since we have 26 choices for the first and then 26 choices for the second.  But only 52 of these possibilities are valid, so our answer is $\\frac{52}{26\\cdot 26} =\\boxed{ \\frac{1}{13}}$.",

You may choose from three ways to solve the problem:\nCase 1: If the problem can be solved with Python code directly, please write a program to solve it. You can enumerate all possible arrangements if needed.\nCase 2: If the problem is mostly reasoning, you can solve it by yourself directly.\nCase 3: If the problem cannot be handled in the above two ways, please follow this process:\n1. Solve the problem step by step (do not over-divide the steps).\n2. Take out any queries that can be asked through Python (for example, any calculations or equations that can be calculated).\n3. Wait for me to give the results.\n4. Continue if you think the result is correct. If the result is invalid or unexpected, please correct your query or reasoning.\n\nAfter all the queries are run and you get the answer, put the answer in \\boxed{}.\n\n\nProblem: All 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, have distinct two-letter postal abbreviations.
