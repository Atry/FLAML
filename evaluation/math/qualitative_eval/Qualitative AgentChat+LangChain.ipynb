      "\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the times when both cameras take pictures. We know that Camera A starts at 6 AM and takes a picture every 11 minutes, and Camera B starts at 7 AM and takes a picture every 7 minutes. We are looking for the fourth time these cameras take a picture at the same time. This is a least common multiple problem where we are trying to find the fourth least common multiple of 11 (Camera A's frequency) and 7 (Camera B's frequency), but we need to consider the starting times of each camera. Therefore, we'll calculate the least common multiple of 11 and 7, then multiply it by 4 to get the fourth occurrence, then subtract the starting times of each camera to find the exact time before noon. To implement this in Python, we need to first calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of 11 and 7.\n",
