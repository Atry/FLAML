      "Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and language models such as ChatGPT-4 (Generative Pretrained Transformer) have made tremendous advances recently and are rapidly transforming the landscape of medicine. Cardiology is among many of the specialties that utilize AI with the intention of improving patient care. Generative AI, with the use of its advanced machine learning algorithms, has the potential to diagnose heart disease and recommend management options suitable for the patient. This may lead to improved patient outcomes not only by recommending the best treatment plan but also by increasing physician efficiency. Language models could assist physicians with administrative tasks, allowing them to spend more time on patient care. However, there are several concerns with the use of AI and language models in the field of medicine. These technologies may not be the most up-to-date with the latest research and could provide outdated information, which may lead to an adverse event. Secondly, AI tools can be expensive, leading to increased healthcare costs and reduced accessibility to the general population. There is also concern about the loss of the human touch and empathy as AI becomes more mainstream. Healthcare professionals would need to be adequately trained to utilize these tools. While AI and language models have many beneficial traits, all healthcare providers need to be involved and aware of generative AI so as to assure its optimal use and mitigate any potential risks and challenges associated with its implementation. In this review, we discuss the various uses of language models in the field of cardiology.\n",

We submitted five articles to Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) for summarization, and asked the article's author to rate the summaries. Higher ratings were assigned to more insight-oriented activities, such as the production of eighth-grade reading level summaries, and summaries highlighting the most important findings and real-world applications. The general summary request was rated lower. For the field of environmental health science, no-cost AI technology such as ChatGPT holds the promise to improve research translation, but it must continue to be improved (or improve itself) from its current capability.\n",

LLMs have been shown to be useful in a myriad of health care-related tasks and processes. In this paper, I argue that attention to, public access to, and debate about LLMs have initiated a wave of products and services using generative artificial intelligence (AI), which had previously found it hard to attract physicians. This paper describes what AI tools have become available since the beginning of the ChatGPT revolution and contemplates how it they might change physicians' perceptions about this breakthrough technology.\n",

      "URL: https://europepmc.org/article/MED/37610808\n",
      "Publication Date: 2023-08-23\n",
      "Abstract: Letters of recommendation play a significant role in higher education and career progression, particularly for women and underrepresented groups in medicine and science. Already, there is evidence to suggest that written letters of recommendation contain language that expresses implicit biases, or unconscious biases, and that these biases occur for all recommenders regardless of the recommender's sex. Given that all individuals have implicit biases that may influence language use, there may be opportunities to apply contemporary technologies, such as large language models or other forms of generative artificial intelligence (AI), to augment and potentially reduce implicit biases in the written language of letters of recommendation. In this editorial, we provide a brief overview of existing literature on the manifestations of implicit bias in letters of recommendation, with a focus on academia and medical education. We then highlight potential opportunities and drawbacks of applying this emerging technology in augmenting the focused, professional task of writing letters of recommendation. We also offer best practices for integrating their use into the routine writing of letters of recommendation and conclude with our outlook for the future of generative AI applications in supporting this task.\n",

      "Publication Date: 2023-08-07\n",
      "Abstract: <h4>Introduction</h4>Open-source generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications are fast-transforming access to information and allow students to prepare assignments and offer quite accurate responses to a wide range of exam questions which are routinely used in assessments of students across the board including undergraduate dental students. This study aims to evaluate the performance of Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT), a generative AI-based application, on a wide range of assessments used in contemporary healthcare education and discusses the implications for undergraduate dental education.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>This was an exploratory study investigating the accuracy of ChatGPT to attempt a range of recognised assessments in healthcare education curricula. A total of 50 independent items encompassing 50 different learning outcomes (n = 10 per item) were developed by the research team. These included 10 separate items based on each of the five commonly used question formats including multiple-choice questions (MCQs); short-answer questions (SAQs); short essay questions (SEQs); single true/false questions; and fill in the blanks items. Chat GPT was used to attempt each of these 50 questions. In addition, ChatGPT was used to generate reflective reports based on multisource feedback; research methodology; and critical appraisal of the literature.<h4>Results</h4>ChatGPT application provided accurate responses to majority of knowledge-based assessments based on MCQs, SAQs, SEQs, true/false and fill in the blanks items. However, it was only able to answer text-based questions and did not allow processing of questions based on images. Responses generated to written assignments were also satisfactory apart from those for critical appraisal of literature. Word count was the key limitation observed in outputs generated by the free version of ChatGPT.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Notwithstanding their current limitations, generative AI-based applications have the potential to revolutionise virtual learning. Instead of treating it as a threat, healthcare educators need to adapt teaching and assessments in medical and dental education to the benefits of the learners while mitigating against dishonest use of AI-based technology.\n",

      "Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI), including large language models (LLMs), is poised to transform scientific research, enabling researchers to elevate their research productivity. This article presents a how-to guide for employing LLMs in academic settings, focusing on their unique strengths, constraints and implications through the lens of philosophy of science and epistemology. Using ChatGPT as a case study, I identify and elaborate on three attributes contributing to its effectiveness—intelligence, versatility and collaboration—accompanied by tips on crafting effective prompts, practical use cases and a living resource online (https://osf.io/8vpwu/). Next, I evaluate the limitations of generative AI and its implications for ethical use, equality and education. Regarding ethical and responsible use, I argue from technical and epistemic standpoints that there is no need to restrict the scope or nature of AI assistance, provided that its use is transparently disclosed. A pressing challenge, however, lies in detecting fake research, which can be mitigated by embracing open science practices, such as transparent peer review and sharing data, code and materials. Addressing equality, I contend that while generative AI may promote equality for some, it may simultaneously exacerbate disparities for others—an issue with potentially significant yet unclear ramifications as it unfolds. Lastly, I consider the implications for education, advocating for active engagement with LLMs and cultivating students' critical thinking and analytical skills. The how-to guide seeks to empower researchers with the knowledge and resources necessary to effectively harness generative AI while navigating the complex ethical dilemmas intrinsic to its application.\n",

      "Abstract: The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has revolutionized the field of medicine. Although highly effective, the rapid expansion of this technology has created some anticipated and unanticipated bioethical considerations. With these powerful applications, there is a necessity for framework regulations to ensure equitable and safe deployment of technology. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are emerging ML techniques that have immense applications in medical imaging due to their ability to produce synthetic medical images and aid in medical AI training. Producing accurate synthetic images with GANs can address current limitations in AI development for medical imaging and overcome current dataset type and size constraints. Offsetting these constraints can dramatically improve the development and implementation of AI medical imaging and restructure the practice of medicine. As observed with its other AI predecessors, considerations must be taken into place to help regulate its development for clinical use. In this paper, we discuss the legal, ethical, and technical challenges for future safe integration of this technology in the healthcare sector.\n",

In this paper, based on the binding pose of the reported compound (GLPG-3970, 3) with AlphaFold protein structure, a series of hinge cores were generated via AI-generative models (Chemistry42). After the molecular docking, synthesis, and biological evaluation, a hit molecule (7f) targeting SIK2 was obtained with a novel scaffold. Further SAR exploration led to the discovery of compound 8g with superior potency against SIK2 compared with the reported inhibitors. Furthermore, 8g also demonstrated excellent selectivity over other AMPK kinases, favorable in vitro ADMET profiles and decent cellular activities. This work provides an alternative approach to the discovery of novel and selective kinase inhibitors.\n",

Drawing on a wealth of professional and academic experience, we propose that LLMs hold promise for revolutionizing medical curriculum development, teaching methodologies, personalized study plans and learning materials, student assessments, and more. However, we also critically examine the challenges that such integration might pose by addressing issues of algorithmic bias, overreliance, plagiarism, misinformation, inequity, privacy, and copyright concerns in medical education. As we navigate the shift from an information-driven educational paradigm to an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven educational paradigm, we argue that it is paramount to understand both the potential and the pitfalls of LLMs in medical education. This paper thus offers our perspective on the opportunities and challenges of using LLMs in this context.

This study sought to assess ChatGPT's capabilities as a source of medical knowledge, using Google Search as a comparison.<h4>Study design</h4>Cross-sectional analysis.<h4>Setting</h4>Online using ChatGPT, Google Seach, and Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG).<h4>Methods</h4>CPG Plain Language Summaries for 6 conditions were obtained. Questions relevant to specific conditions were developed and input into ChatGPT and Google Search. All questions were written from the patient perspective and sought (1) general medical knowledge or (2) medical recommendations, with varying levels of acuity (urgent or emergent vs routine clinical scenarios). Two blinded reviewers scored all passages and compared results from ChatGPT and Google Search, using the Patient Education Material Assessment Tool (PEMAT-P) as the primary outcome. Additional customized questions were developed that assessed the medical content of the passages.<h4>Results</h4>The overall average PEMAT-P score for medical advice was 68.2% (standard deviation [SD]: 4.4) for ChatGPT and 89.4% (SD: 5.9) for Google Search (p < .001). There was a statistically significant difference in the PEMAT-P score by source (p < .001) but not by urgency of the clinical situation (p = .613). ChatGPT scored significantly higher than Google Search (87% vs 78%, p = .012) for patient education questions.<h4>Conclusion</h4>ChatGPT fared better than Google Search when offering general medical knowledge, but it scored worse when providing medical recommendations.

      "Abstract: Deep learning models can achieve high accuracy when trained on large amounts of labeled data. However, real-world scenarios often involve several challenges: Training data may become available in installments, may originate from multiple different domains, and may not contain labels for training. Certain settings, for instance medical applications, often involve further restrictions that prohibit retention of previously seen data due to privacy regulations. In this work, to address such challenges, we study unsupervised segmentation in continual learning scenarios that involve domain shift. To that end, we introduce GarDA (Generative Appearance Replay for continual Domain Adaptation), a generative-replay based approach that can adapt a segmentation model sequentially to new domains with unlabeled data. In contrast to single-step unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), continual adaptation to a sequence of domains enables leveraging and consolidation of information from multiple domains. Unlike previous approaches in incremental UDA, our method does not require access to previously seen data, making it applicable in many practical scenarios. We evaluate GarDA on three datasets with different organs and modalities, where it substantially outperforms existing techniques.

      "Publication Date: 2023-05-31\n",
      "Abstract: <h4>Background</h4>Artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced substantially in recent years, transforming many industries and improving the way people live and work. In scientific research, AI can enhance the quality and efficiency of data analysis and publication. However, AI has also opened up the possibility of generating high-quality fraudulent papers that are difficult to detect, raising important questions about the integrity of scientific research and the trustworthiness of published papers.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of this study was to investigate the capabilities of current AI language models in generating high-quality fraudulent medical articles. We hypothesized that modern AI models can create highly convincing fraudulent papers that can easily deceive readers and even experienced researchers.<h4>Methods</h4>This proof-of-concept study used ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) powered by the GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) language model to generate a fraudulent scientific article related to neurosurgery. GPT-3 is a large language model developed by OpenAI that uses deep learning algorithms to generate human-like text in response to prompts given by users. The model was trained on a massive corpus of text from the internet and is capable of generating high-quality text in a variety of languages and on various topics. The authors posed questions and prompts to the model and refined them iteratively as the model generated the responses. The goal was to create a completely fabricated article including the abstract, introduction, material and methods, discussion, references, charts, etc. Once the article was generated, it was reviewed for accuracy and coherence by experts in the fields of neurosurgery, psychiatry, and statistics and compared to existing similar articles.<h4>Results</h4>The study found that the AI language model can create a highly convincing fraudulent article that resembled a genuine scientific paper in terms of word usage, sentence structure, and overall composition. The AI-generated article included standard sections such as introduction, material and methods, results, and discussion, as well a data sheet. It consisted of 1992 words and 17 citations, and the whole process of article creation took approximately 1 hour without any special training of the human user. However, there were some concerns and specific mistakes identified in the generated article, specifically in the references.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The study demonstrates the potential of current AI language models to generate completely fabricated scientific articles. Although the papers look sophisticated and seemingly flawless, expert readers may identify semantic inaccuracies and errors upon closer inspection. We highlight the need for increased vigilance and better detection methods to combat the potential misuse of AI in scientific research. At the same time, it is important to recognize the potential benefits of using AI language models in genuine scientific writing and research, such as manuscript preparation and language editing.\n",

      "Abstract: <p>This article provides a conceptual framework - “CRITiCS” - for potential use in the design and deployment of generative AI systems to support clinical decision making in mental health services. Recent advances in generative AI, via massive parameter transformer networks (large language models such as GPT4) have rendered possible the use of cognitive agents that may support clinical productivity in mental healthcare, particularly in secondary and tertiary services where information load is proportional to clinical complexity and chronicity. Thus, the way we conceptualise the ‘cognitive space’ that, up to 2023, was occupied solely by human clinical reasoning, will inevitably change. However, there are transparency issues in that the cognitive emulation observed in LLM outputs, while of obvious potential benefit as an analogue of clinical reasoning,is not amenable to granular understanding in the same way that clinical decision making is subject to interrogation by human governance and assurance bodies. A consensus conceptual framework is urgently needed, to direct the path of the use of generative agents in mental health care, which we argue has cognitive space features that distinguish it from physical medicine, towards which most AI deployment proposals to date have been directed. It is hoped that this paper will attract discussion and interest in both the clinical and development communities.</p>\n",
