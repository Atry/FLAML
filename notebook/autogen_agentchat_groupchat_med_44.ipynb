      "Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and language models such as ChatGPT-4 (Generative Pretrained Transformer) have made tremendous advances recently and are rapidly transforming the landscape of medicine. Cardiology is among many of the specialties that utilize AI with the intention of improving patient care. Generative AI, with the use of its advanced machine learning algorithms, has the potential to diagnose heart disease and recommend management options suitable for the patient. This may lead to improved patient outcomes not only by recommending the best treatment plan but also by increasing physician efficiency. Language models could assist physicians with administrative tasks, allowing them to spend more time on patient care. However, there are several concerns with the use of AI and language models in the field of medicine. These technologies may not be the most up-to-date with the latest research and could provide outdated information, which may lead to an adverse event. Secondly, AI tools can be expensive, leading to increased healthcare costs and reduced accessibility to the general population. There is also concern about the loss of the human touch and empathy as AI becomes more mainstream. Healthcare professionals would need to be adequately trained to utilize these tools. While AI and language models have many beneficial traits, all healthcare providers need to be involved and aware of generative AI so as to assure its optimal use and mitigate any potential risks and challenges associated with its implementation. In this review, we discuss the various uses of language models in the field of cardiology.\n",

      "Publication Date: 2023-08-23\n",
      "Abstract: Letters of recommendation play a significant role in higher education and career progression, particularly for women and underrepresented groups in medicine and science. Already, there is evidence to suggest that written letters of recommendation contain language that expresses implicit biases, or unconscious biases, and that these biases occur for all recommenders regardless of the recommender's sex. Given that all individuals have implicit biases that may influence language use, there may be opportunities to apply contemporary technologies, such as large language models or other forms of generative artificial intelligence (AI), to augment and potentially reduce implicit biases in the written language of letters of recommendation. In this editorial, we provide a brief overview of existing literature on the manifestations of implicit bias in letters of recommendation, with a focus on academia and medical education. We then highlight potential opportunities and drawbacks of applying this emerging technology in augmenting the focused, professional task of writing letters of recommendation. We also offer best practices for integrating their use into the routine writing of letters of recommendation and conclude with our outlook for the future of generative AI applications in supporting this task.\n",

      "Publication Date: 2023-08-07\n",
      "Abstract: <h4>Introduction</h4>Open-source generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications are fast-transforming access to information and allow students to prepare assignments and offer quite accurate responses to a wide range of exam questions which are routinely used in assessments of students across the board including undergraduate dental students. This study aims to evaluate the performance of Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT), a generative AI-based application, on a wide range of assessments used in contemporary healthcare education and discusses the implications for undergraduate dental education.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>This was an exploratory study investigating the accuracy of ChatGPT to attempt a range of recognised assessments in healthcare education curricula. A total of 50 independent items encompassing 50 different learning outcomes (n = 10 per item) were developed by the research team. These included 10 separate items based on each of the five commonly used question formats including multiple-choice questions (MCQs); short-answer questions (SAQs); short essay questions (SEQs); single true/false questions; and fill in the blanks items. Chat GPT was used to attempt each of these 50 questions. In addition, ChatGPT was used to generate reflective reports based on multisource feedback; research methodology; and critical appraisal of the literature.<h4>Results</h4>ChatGPT application provided accurate responses to majority of knowledge-based assessments based on MCQs, SAQs, SEQs, true/false and fill in the blanks items. However, it was only able to answer text-based questions and did not allow processing of questions based on images. Responses generated to written assignments were also satisfactory apart from those for critical appraisal of literature. Word count was the key limitation observed in outputs generated by the free version of ChatGPT.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Notwithstanding their current limitations, generative AI-based applications have the potential to revolutionise virtual learning. Instead of treating it as a threat, healthcare educators need to adapt teaching and assessments in medical and dental education to the benefits of the learners while mitigating against dishonest use of AI-based technology.\n",

      "Publication Date: 2023-08-23\n",
      "Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI), including large language models (LLMs), is poised to transform scientific research, enabling researchers to elevate their research productivity. This article presents a how-to guide for employing LLMs in academic settings, focusing on their unique strengths, constraints and implications through the lens of philosophy of science and epistemology. Using ChatGPT as a case study, I identify and elaborate on three attributes contributing to its effectiveness—intelligence, versatility and collaboration—accompanied by tips on crafting effective prompts, practical use cases and a living resource online (https://osf.io/8vpwu/). Next, I evaluate the limitations of generative AI and its implications for ethical use, equality and education. Regarding ethical and responsible use, I argue from technical and epistemic standpoints that there is no need to restrict the scope or nature of AI assistance, provided that its use is transparently disclosed. A pressing challenge, however, lies in detecting fake research, which can be mitigated by embracing open science practices, such as transparent peer review and sharing data, code and materials. Addressing equality, I contend that while generative AI may promote equality for some, it may simultaneously exacerbate disparities for others—an issue with potentially significant yet unclear ramifications as it unfolds. Lastly, I consider the implications for education, advocating for active engagement with LLMs and cultivating students' critical thinking and analytical skills. The how-to guide seeks to empower researchers with the knowledge and resources necessary to effectively harness generative AI while navigating the complex ethical dilemmas intrinsic to its application.\n",

      "Abstract: The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has revolutionized the field of medicine. Although highly effective, the rapid expansion of this technology has created some anticipated and unanticipated bioethical considerations. With these powerful applications, there is a necessity for framework regulations to ensure equitable and safe deployment of technology. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are emerging ML techniques that have immense applications in medical imaging due to their ability to produce synthetic medical images and aid in medical AI training. Producing accurate synthetic images with GANs can address current limitations in AI development for medical imaging and overcome current dataset type and size constraints. Offsetting these constraints can dramatically improve the development and implementation of AI medical imaging and restructure the practice of medicine. As observed with its other AI predecessors, considerations must be taken into place to help regulate its development for clinical use. In this paper, we discuss the legal, ethical, and technical challenges for future safe integration of this technology in the healthcare sector.\n",

      "Abstract: Salt-inducible kinase 2 (SIK2) has been recognized as a potential target for anti-inflammation and anti-cancer therapy. In this paper, based on the binding pose of the reported compound (GLPG-3970, 3) with AlphaFold protein structure, a series of hinge cores were generated via AI-generative models (Chemistry42). After the molecular docking, synthesis, and biological evaluation, a hit molecule (7f) targeting SIK2 was obtained with a novel scaffold. Further SAR exploration led to the discovery of compound 8g with superior potency against SIK2 compared with the reported inhibitors. Furthermore, 8g also demonstrated excellent selectivity over other AMPK kinases, favorable in vitro ADMET profiles and decent cellular activities. This work provides an alternative approach to the discovery of novel and selective kinase inhibitors.\n",

Quantum computing is touted to be the next most significant leap in technology; one of the main early practical applications for quantum computing solutions is predicted to be in quantum chemistry simulations. Here, we review the near-term applications of quantum computing and their advantages for generative chemistry and highlight the challenges that can be addressed with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We also discuss the possible integration of generative systems running on quantum computers into established generative AI platforms.\n",

The advent of Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) has taken the world by storm with its potential uses and efficiencies. However, technology leaders, researchers, educators, and policy makers have also sounded the alarm on its potential harms and unintended consequences. AI will increasingly find its way into medicine and is a force of both disruption and innovation.

      "Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs), such as those in the Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) series, into medical education has the potential to transform learning experiences for students and elevate their knowledge, skills, and competence. Drawing on a wealth of professional and academic experience, we propose that LLMs hold promise for revolutionizing medical curriculum development, teaching methodologies, personalized study plans and learning materials, student assessments, and more. However, we also critically examine the challenges that such integration might pose by addressing issues of algorithmic bias, overreliance, plagiarism, misinformation, inequity, privacy, and copyright concerns in medical education. As we navigate the shift from an information-driven educational paradigm to an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven educational paradigm, we argue that it is paramount to understand both the potential and the pitfalls of LLMs in medical education. This paper thus offers our perspective on the opportunities and challenges of using LLMs in this context. We believe that the insights gleaned from this analysis will serve as a foundation for future recommendations and best practices in the field, fostering the responsible and effective use of AI technologies in medical education.\n",

      "Abstract: Chat generative pre-trained transformer (ChatGPT) is a chatbot developed by OpenAI that answers questions in a human-like manner. ChatGPT is a GPT language model that understands and responds to natural language created using a transformer, which is a new artificial neural network algorithm first introduced by Google in 2017. ChatGPT can be used to identify research topics and proofread English writing and R scripts to improve work efficiency and optimize time. Attempts to actively utilize generative artificial intelligence (AI) are expected to continue in clinical settings. However, ChatGPT still has many limitations for widespread use in clinical research, owing to AI hallucination symptoms and its training data constraints. Researchers recommend avoiding scientific writing using ChatGPT in many traditional journals because of the current lack of originality guidelines and plagiarism of content generated by ChatGPT. Further regulations and discussions on these topics are expected in the future.\n",
