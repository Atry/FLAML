    "# Auto Generated Agent Chat: Solving Tasks Requiring Web Info\n",
    "\n",
    "`flaml.autogen` offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool or human, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framwork allows tool use and human participance through multi-agent conversation.\n",
    "Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Autogen#agents).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` to perform tasks which require acquiring info from the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here `AssistantAgent` is an LLM-based agent that can write Python code (in a Python coding block) for a user to execute for a given task. `UserProxyAgent` is an agent which serves as a proxy for a user to execute the code written by `AssistantAgent`. By setting `human_input_mode` properly, the `UserProxyAgent` can also prompt the user for feedback to `AssistantAgent`. For example, when `human_input_mode` is set to \"TERMINATE\", the `UserProxyAgent` will execute the code written by `AssistantAgent` directly and return the execution results (success or failure and corresponding outputs) to `AssistantAgent`, and prompt the user for feedback when the task is finished. When user feedback is provided, the `UserProxyAgent` will directly pass the feedback to `AssistantAgent`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "FLAML requires `Python>=3.8`. To run this notebook example, please install flaml with the [autogen] option and docker:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install flaml[autogen]\n",
