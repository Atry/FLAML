They also are a promising new technology for concept-oriented deep\\nlearning (CODL). However, the prerequisite is that LLMs understand concepts and\\nensure conceptual consistency. We discuss these in this paper, as well as major\\nuses of LLMs for CODL including concept extraction from text, concept graph\\nextraction from text, and concept learning. Human knowledge consists of both\\nsymbolic (conceptual) knowledge and embodied (sensory) knowledge. Text-only\\nLLMs, however, can represent only symbolic (conceptual) knowledge. Multimodal\\nLLMs, on the other hand, are capable of representing the full range (conceptual\\nand sensory) of human knowledge. We discuss conceptual understanding in\\nvisual-language LLMs, the most important multimodal LLMs, and major uses of\\nthem for CODL including concept extraction from image, concept graph extraction\\nfrom image, and concept learning. While uses of LLMs for CODL are valuable\\nstandalone, they are particularly valuable as part of LLM applications such as\\nAI chatbots.\\n</p>']\n",

(arXiv:2303.11156v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED). \\n Abstract: <p>In this paper, both empirically and theoretically, we show that several\\nAI-text detectors are not reliable in practical scenarios. Empirically, we show\\nthat paraphrasing attacks, where a light paraphraser is applied on top of a\\nlarge language model (LLM), can break a whole range of detectors, including\\nones using watermarking schemes as well as neural network-based detectors and\\nzero-shot classifiers. Our experiments demonstrate that retrieval-based\\ndetectors, designed to evade paraphrasing attacks, are still vulnerable to\\nrecursive paraphrasing. We then provide a theoretical impossibility result\\nindicating that as language models become more sophisticated and better at\\nemulating human text, the performance of even the best-possible detector\\ndecreases. For a sufficiently advanced language model seeking to imitate human\\ntext, even the best-possible detector may only perform marginally better than a\\nrandom classifier. Our result is general enough to capture specific scenarios\\nsuch as particular writing styles, clever prompt design, or text paraphrasing.\\nWe also extend the impossibility result to include the case where pseudorandom\\nnumber generators are used for AI-text generation instead of true randomness.\\nWe show that the same result holds with a negligible correction term for all\\npolynomial-time computable detectors. Finally, we show that even LLMs protected\\nby watermarking schemes can be vulnerable against spoofing attacks where\\nadversarial humans can infer hidden LLM text signatures and add them to\\nhuman-generated text to be detected as text generated by the LLMs, potentially\\ncausing reputational damage to their developers. We believe these results can\\nopen an honest conversation in the community regarding the ethical and reliable\\nuse of AI-generated text.\\n</p>']\n",

(arXiv:2304.07396v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED). \\n Abstract: <p>Physicians considering clinical trials for their patients are met with the\\nlaborious process of checking many text based eligibility criteria. Large\\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have shown to perform well for clinical information\\nextraction and clinical reasoning, including medical tests, but not yet in\\nreal-world scenarios. This paper investigates the use of InstructGPT to assist\\nphysicians in determining eligibility for clinical trials based on a patient's\\nsummarised medical profile. Using a prompting strategy combining one-shot,\\nselection-inference and chain-of-thought techniques, we investigate the\\nperformance of LLMs on 10 synthetically created patient profiles. Performance\\nis evaluated at four levels: ability to identify screenable eligibility\\ncriteria from a trial given a medical profile; ability to classify for each\\nindividual criterion whether the patient qualifies; the overall classification\\nwhether a patient is eligible for a clinical trial and the percentage of\\ncriteria to be screened by physician. We evaluated against 146 clinical trials\\nand a total of 4,135 eligibility criteria. The LLM was able to correctly\\nidentify the screenability of 72% (2,994/4,135) of the criteria. Additionally,\\n72% (341/471) of the screenable criteria were evaluated correctly. The\\nresulting trial level classification as eligible or ineligible resulted in a\\nrecall of 0.5. By leveraging LLMs with a physician-in-the-loop, a recall of 1.0\\nand precision of 0.71 on clinical trial level can be achieved while reducing\\nthe amount of criteria to be checked by an estimated 90%. LLMs can be used to\\nassist physicians with pre-screening of patients for clinical trials. By\\nforcing instruction-tuned LLMs to produce chain-of-thought responses, the\\nreasoning can be made transparent to and the decision process becomes amenable\\nby physicians, thereby making such a system feasible for use in real-world\\nscenarios.\\n</p>\"]\n",

      "data4learning: ['<p>Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions\\ngoverned by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop\\ncapable AI algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language. As a major\\napproach, language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding\\nand generation in the past two decades, evolving from statistical language\\nmodels to neural language models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs)\\nhave been proposed by pre-training Transformer models over large-scale corpora,\\nshowing strong capabilities in solving various NLP tasks. Since researchers\\nhave found that model scaling can lead to performance improvement, they further\\nstudy the scaling effect by increasing the model size to an even larger size.\\nInterestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged\\nlanguage models not only achieve a significant performance improvement but also\\nshow some special abilities that are not present in small-scale language\\nmodels. To discriminate the difference in parameter scale, the research\\ncommunity has coined the term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of\\nsignificant size. Recently, the research on LLMs has been largely advanced by\\nboth academia and industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT,\\nwhich has attracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution\\nof LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which\\nwould revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. In this\\nsurvey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background,\\nkey findings, and mainstream techniques. In particular, we focus on four major\\naspects of LLMs, namely pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and\\ncapacity evaluation. Besides, we also summarize the available resources for\\ndeveloping LLMs and discuss the remaining issues for future directions.\\n</p>']\n",

      "data4learning: [\"<p>Physicians considering clinical trials for their patients are met with the\\nlaborious process of checking many text based eligibility criteria. Large\\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have shown to perform well for clinical information\\nextraction and clinical reasoning, including medical tests, but not yet in\\nreal-world scenarios. This paper investigates the use of InstructGPT to assist\\nphysicians in determining eligibility for clinical trials based on a patient's\\nsummarised medical profile. Using a prompting strategy combining one-shot,\\nselection-inference and chain-of-thought techniques, we investigate the\\nperformance of LLMs on 10 synthetically created patient profiles. Performance\\nis evaluated at four levels: ability to identify screenable eligibility\\ncriteria from a trial given a medical profile; ability to classify for each\\nindividual criterion whether the patient qualifies; the overall classification\\nwhether a patient is eligible for a clinical trial and the percentage of\\ncriteria to be screened by physician. We evaluated against 146 clinical trials\\nand a total of 4,135 eligibility criteria. The LLM was able to correctly\\nidentify the screenability of 72% (2,994/4,135) of the criteria. Additionally,\\n72% (341/471) of the screenable criteria were evaluated correctly. The\\nresulting trial level classification as eligible or ineligible resulted in a\\nrecall of 0.5. By leveraging LLMs with a physician-in-the-loop, a recall of 1.0\\nand precision of 0.71 on clinical trial level can be achieved while reducing\\nthe amount of criteria to be checked by an estimated 90%. LLMs can be used to\\nassist physicians with pre-screening of patients for clinical trials. By\\nforcing instruction-tuned LLMs to produce chain-of-thought responses, the\\nreasoning can be made transparent to and the decision process becomes amenable\\nby physicians, thereby making such a system feasible for use in real-world\\nscenarios.\\n</p>\"]\n",
